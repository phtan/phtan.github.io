In the experimental language 
<a href="https://circusfreaks.org/tokipona/#kama-sona-e-toki-pona">
Toki Pona</a>, it means
"Simple is cute". Specifically, I meant
<a href="http://simpleweb.iscute.ovh/">
    "Simple Web is cute"
    </a>, but there is no word for the Web, in Toki Pona, 
as far as I am aware (I'm a beginner at Toki Pona, as at 
20th December 2019).
  </p>
<p>Alternatively, because of the ambiguity inherent in Toki Pona, 
"Pona li pona" could mean, among a number of things, "good is good". 
Or, because I think of God as good: "God is good."
