    Someone from <a href="https://tilde.town/">my town</a> said: "The Internet is going to be the biggest necropolis - the biggest cemetery, the biggest graveyard - of our time."

    Think about it - as morbid as it seems - what if you die of sudden heart failure tomorrow? What will happen to your Instagram account? And who among your "followers" will 
    know that you have died at such-and-such place, in such-and-such manner?
  </p>
  <p>
    Now think about this - how many Web-pages are there in the whole of cyber-space? And how many authors of those Web-pages are now dead?
  </p>
  <p>
    So this is my way of giving my online existence a dignified end. Congratulations, you have found my e-tombstone.
