        <h2>Context</h2>
  <p>
    Someone from <a href="https://tilde.town/">my town</a> said: "The Internet is going to be the biggest necropolis - the biggest cemetery, the biggest graveyard - of our time."
  </p>
  <p>
    Think about it - as morbid as it seems - what if you die of sudden heart failure tomorrow? What happens to your Instagram account? Who among your "followers" will 
    know that you have died at this specific place, in that specific matter?
  </p>
  <p>
    Now think about this - how many Web-pages are there in the whole of cyber-space? And how many of those Web-pages are from people who are now dead?
  </p>
  <p>
    So this is my way of giving my online existence a dignified end. Congratulations, you have found my e-tombstone.
