<h2>About this web-site
</h2>
  <p>This web-site is written by Tony Chen (me!). On his national identity-document, his name is printed as "Tan Pheng Heong (Chen Bingxiong)".
    As far as he can recall, he had no say in how his name was printed on that document. He chose the name "Tony" but not his surname.

	<h3>Colour scheme

	<p>I observe, and adapt, a colour-scheme called Solarized, which is
apparently by a Ethan Schoonover.
