<p><b>Untitled haiku
</b>
</p>
<p>シンガポールで <br />
コーヒを飲みます <br />
永遠の夏 
</p>
<p>

Sipping coffee here <br />
Heat of Singapore tropics <br />
Eternal summer

  <p><b>Untitled
    </b>
  </p>
<p>No, my trip to the <br />
  sea-shore <br />
  wasn't a dream <br />
  See- <br />
  The sand on my feet-
</p>
<hr />
<p>
  <b>Away to (hopefully) safety: A poem, written after reading 
    Loung Ung's "First they killed my father"
  </b><br />
  </p>
  <p>
  Wordlessly, <br />
  I smacked the coffee-stain <br />
  on its rump- <br />
  And checked- <br />
  Was it gone? <br />
  Maybe, the sea - where I had sent it to - was not its home, <br />
  but then, <br />
  neither was I; <br />
  Or, I could no longer be
  </p>

<b>To you <br />
</b>
<p>
  I’ve made markings on the shore <br />

You’ll have to go there, before <br />

 the next time of high-tide, <br />

If you want to see it - <br />

You know the sea will devour it <br />

Ain’t that like Snapchat without <br />

The electricity? <br />

You have… Twelve hours, <br />

Maybe?<br />

What?<br />

You’re avoiding the beach,<br />

You want to see it on the SnapMap<br />

While you commute on a public bus,<br />

And even then,<br />

You might - might - decide not to give the SnapMap<br />

Any attention,<br />

You’re busy clucking at the bus-driver while<br />

He jerks the bus perversely along?<br />

I don’t trust<br />

You<br />

Nor your fickle<br />

Attention<br />

I- I’ll thank God<br />

For the sea<br />

For the sun<br />

For the wind<br />

For the sand
<br />
For the little child, shrieking in delight
<br />
As the waves roll in
<br />
I’ll pray to God
<br />
To make me his wife
<br />
We’ll marry, if He is willing
<br />
And then,
<br />
And then,
<br />
I’ll pray for you,
<br />
That you’ll have food
<br />
When you’re hungry
<br />
And water
<br />
When you’re thirsty
<br />
And then,
<br />
I won’t see you
<br />
I won’t be on the SnapMap
<br />
You don’t need to thank me
<br />
I’m your (unworthy) servant,
<br />
A hopeful wife of God,
<br />
Servant of God,
<br />
Child of God
<br />
(I don't mind being
<br />
A door-keeper in God’s house,
<br />
Either)
<br />
Not a lioness of God,
<br />
Sylvia Plath said she was one,
<br />
And then she committed
<br />
Suicide
