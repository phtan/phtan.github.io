<p>シンガポールで <br />
コーヒを飲みます <br />
永遠の夏

Sipping coffee here <br />
Heat of Singapore tropics <br />
Eternal summer

  <p><b>Untitled
    </b>
  </p>
<p>No, my trip to the <br />
  sea-shore <br />
  wasn't a dream <br />
  See- <br />
  The sand on my feet-
</p>
 <br /> 
 <br />

  <b>Away to (hopefully) safety: A poem, written after reading 
    Loung Ung's "First they killed my father"
  </b><br />
  </p>
  <p>
  Wordlessly, <br />
  I smacked the coffee-stain <br />
  on its rump- <br />
  And checked- <br />
  Was it gone? <br />
  Maybe, the sea - where I had sent it to - was not its home, <br />
  but then, <br />
  neither was I; <br />
  Or, I could no longer be
  </p>

<p><b>A haiku in the 21st century
</b></p>

<p>Sea-water. Wet socks. <br />
What is that shiny thing there? <br />
I don't know. Space-ship?
