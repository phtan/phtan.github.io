<p><b>Untitled haiku

<p>シンガポールで <br />
コーヒを飲みます <br />
永遠の夏 
</p>

<p>

Sipping coffee here <br />
Heat of Singapore tropics <br />
Eternal summer

  <p><b>Untitled
    </b>
  </p>
<p>No, my trip to the <br />
  sea-shore <br />
  wasn't a dream <br />
  See- <br />
  The sand on my feet-
</p>
 <br /> 
 <br />

  <b>Away to (hopefully) safety: A poem, written after reading 
    Loung Ung's "First they killed my father"
  </b><br />
  </p>
  <p>
  Wordlessly, <br />
  I smacked the coffee-stain <br />
  on its rump- <br />
  And checked- <br />
  Was it gone? <br />
  Maybe, the sea - where I had sent it to - was not its home, <br />
  but then, <br />
  neither was I; <br />
  Or, I could no longer be
  </p>

<p><b>A haiku in the 21st century
</b></p>

  <strikethrough>
<p>Sea-water. Wet socks. <br />
What is that shiny thing there? <br />
I don't know. Space-ship?
</p>
    
</strikethrough>
  
  <p>Sea-water. Salty.<br />
What is that shiny thing there? <br />
Satellite debris

  <p><b>
    Durians
  </b>
  </p>
<p>
  During a durable durian season <br />
Tourists carefully took a taste <br />
Oh! Wheezing and sneezing <br />
Some abstained <br />
<br />
Durian, so divisive <br />
The pulp, so cohesive <br />
Its spikes, can't help but pierce <br />
Eat it thrice, does it induce tears? <br />
<br />
Run away from the porcupine-husk <br />
It gets solitude, at last <br />
A protective shell repels; <br />
Invites lovers; disgusts all else <br />
<br />
Durian, what is it? <br />
Must be some evil treat! <br />
Creamy flesh, pungent smell <br />
Don't complain about this hell <br />
<br />
Nest of centipedes, lay in wait <br />
Come ye, brave hunters, <br />
'tis not too late! <br />
<br />
'tis harvest season — <br />
Who wants some? <br />
Durian-lovers — <br />
I bid you come! 
</p>
