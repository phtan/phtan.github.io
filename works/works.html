<p><b>Philosophy
</b>
</p>
<p>I am inspired by the story of a master of the martial art Aikido, who wore a white belt - the belt beginners wear. I strive for a Beginner's Mind - open to mistakes, to be sure, and/but also open to learning - always fresh: it could even be said I strive to have the mind of a little child. There is a story in Zen Buddhism, about how a cup full of old tea is not ready to accept new tea: a reminder to myself to empty my mind, in a way.

<p><b>Commissions
</b>
</p>
<p>I am not accepting commissions, at the moment, generally speaking. For now, I am happy to be the one commissioning my works.
