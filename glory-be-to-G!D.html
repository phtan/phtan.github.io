<i>As for me and my House, we shall worship the LORD :-) (from Scriptures)
</i>

<p>
Now go, write it on a tablet before them
            And inscribe it on a scroll,
            That it may serve in the time to come
            As a witness forever.

      For this is a rebellious people, false sons,
            Sons who refuse to listen
            To the instruction of the LORD;

      Who say to the seers, “You must not see visions”;
            And to the prophets, “You must not prophesy to us what is right,
            Speak to us pleasant words,
            Prophesy illusions.

      “Get out of the way, turn aside from the path,
            Let us hear no more about the Holy One of Israel.”

Therefore thus says the Holy One of Israel,
            “Since you have rejected this word
            And have put your trust in oppression and guile, and have relied on them,

      Therefore this iniquity will be to you
            Like a breach about to fall,
            A bulge in a high wall,
            Whose collapse comes suddenly in an instant,

      Whose collapse is like the smashing of a potter’s jar,
            So ruthlessly shattered
            That a sherd will not be found among its pieces
            To take fire from a hearth
            Or to scoop water from a cistern.”
