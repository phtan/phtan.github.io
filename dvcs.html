        Summary: Tony Chen (Pheng Heong) has read some of these materials about FOSS, 
      and he has heard of some attitudes towards FOSS, upon which he plans to base his
      very short talk. Not planning to talk for more than 5 minutes. 
      These are the articles that you could also read. You could then air your views 
      after hearing his.

  <h3>Journal
  </h3>
  <p>As of 12th June 2020, I've just set up a journal, titled "Journal of a part-time technologist".
  </p>
  <p>
I assume the viewer of such a journal is familiar enough with Github, to figure out how to read an entry in my journal.
  </p>
  <p>
Three entries so far.
