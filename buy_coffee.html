<h3>Coffee
</h3>

<p>Like many people around the world, I drink
coffee regularly.
<p>
<p>

So you want to buy me a coffee? Ordinarily, I would
give you <a href="https://www.paypal.me/tonytoni">my Paypal details</a>.
 But these times - especially since the pandemic began
 in the year 2020 - have been difficult for so many other people.
</p>
<p>So I would like to invite you to give to
other people instead:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/uk/">UN Refugee Agency</a> provides 
shelter for people who 
are fleeing violent conflict.
</li>

<li><a href="http://www.vic.org.kh/">Veterans International Cambodia</a> makes and distributes 
wheelchairs to people who face challenges in mobility.
</li>


<li>I've been making <a href="https://github.com/phtan/technologist-journal/search?p=1&q=tip&type=">lists</a> of 
other people who welcome money. (I call those lists "tip jars". Some 
people collect stamps. I collect tip jars.)
</li>
</ul>
