  <p>I hope that with the following question-and-answer(s), the reader may gain a better

<p id="ec">What are your (other) interests? - E.C.
</p>
<p>
  Well, I would categorise my interests into three:
<ol>
 <li>Ones I am currently working on
  </li>
<li>Ones I haven't developed much (yet)
  </li>
<li>Ones I've pursued to some extent, but which I've put on hold
  </li>
  </ol>
  
For number 1, I count these:
  <ul>
<li> Learning Indonesian language
    </li>
<li> Reading books (let me know if you want to know which books in particular)
    </li>
<li> Learning the programming language Python, as a means for me to get a computer to help me with some stuff
    </li>
    </ul>
  
For number 2 - hobbies/interests I have yet to much develop:
  <ul>
<li>make-up (as in painting faces)
    </li>
<li>Landscape gardening (possibly in the Zen style)
    </li>
  </ul>

For number 3 (hobbies/interests on hold):
<ul>
  <li> Photography
  </li>
<li> Learning Japanese language
  </li>
  </ul>

<p>Comedy (as well as a sense of humour, if I may say so myself). My research includes
  watching episodes of Seinfeld, and reading manga. I hope their comedic effects are something I can absorb.
