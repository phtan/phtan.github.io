<p>
  
It means having the confidence to deal with anything that life can throw at me.
</p>
  <p>
To clarify - it is not about appearing "strong and invincible", but about having enough softness and adaptability, inside me, to deal with sudden changes in the outside world.
  </p>
  <p>
The image is that of a bamboo plant that bends when it encounters a strong gust of wind - and it avoids being broken into two - as contrasted to a more rigid and stiffer plant.
  </p>
  <p>
And it is about having the discernment to choose between a skillful and unskillful response to life.
  
One would lead to my benefit, but the other to my detriment

Am I wise enough to pick one and avoid the other? I have to ask myself that question many times, because a moment of carelessness can bring me disastrous consequences.
  </p>
  <p>
And it is about living without any dread of the future, anguish about the past, and frustration with the present moment.

That's not to say I don't feel any of those feelings - I'm human after all - but they should pose no long-term hindrance to my experience of happiness and contentment.
</p>
  <p>
  
In more concrete - or actionable - terms, it means surrounding myself with wise people and avoiding foolish people.
  </p>
  <p>
I frequently check if my choices in life meet

</b>
</p>
<p>
  I had a "rude awakening" after a series of incidents that involved expensive stuff I've bought. I either misplaced it, or someone else stole it. After experiencing that, I simply could not bear to see any more of my money fly away so suddenly. I became more determined to use more of free stuff (such as clothes and accessories) that other people are giving away (because they no longer want it.)

</p>


<p>
I once took an undergraduate-course on Composing Music in the Classical 
Style (for example, in the style of Mozart). For an assignment in that 
course, I wrote a musical work that appears to be thoroughly 
twentieth-century, instead of looking eighteenth-century. My 
course-instructor did not accept my work, but I still had fun. 
(I’ve realised the importance of surrounding myself with people who 
value creativity and innovation - which is not everyone, and I 
certainly don’t really appreciate flattery and/or smooth talk, either).

Tell me what is your oops-boo-hoo moment this week, and what you learnt 
from it. - M.P.
</b>
</p>
<p>
An “oops-boo-hoo” of mine, as you call it? I run a blog where I post 
photos from my trips to art-galleries in Sg. Art-hunting, if you will. 
But I got a little lost; something didn’t feel right (about such 
blogging) anymore. I asked the person known, on LinkedIn, as Alin 
Sneha Abraham, for her perspective on the matter; I said I wasn’t sure 
if my blogging was adding value to the world. Alin said something to 
the effect that it is more important that I enjoy myself; that way, at 
least one person benefits. So my oops-boo-hoo was to overlook my own 
enjoyment of the activity in question. I concluded that I liked 
visiting galleries, but posting photos on social media? Not so much.

Oh, it's you again, M.P. (Hi again!) I try to have some fun with the ground that is 
given me. Like, I try to appreciate the ground I have - yes, the 
ground. Like, it’s so stable. And I can have access to it. Ms. Vaishali,
 who seems to teach yoga, elaborates the idea, in the following

In my early twenties, I volunteered to facilitate a week-long camping 
activity, during which I got very little sleep. I would evaluate my own 
performance, during that camp, as poor - I just wasn’t getting enough 
sleep.
</p>
<p>
Fast forward about a decade, now I value my sleeping hours. I avoid 
taking on overnight jobs, because I know I won’t be at my best. I’ve 
learnt to manage myself a little, I guess - and that counts as a 
success to me!

<p><b>What’s the best gift you have ever received from a leader? - C.C.

</p>
<p>Difficult to say which has been the best for me, since there are a 
few good ones I can identify (which I am thankful for, of course). I 
would highlight, as my response to your post, opportunities that a 
teacher gave me, when I was 10 years old (approximately). I had 
interest in making flashy animation with the software Macromedia Flash 
(which is now apparently obsolete). I guess that teacher liked what I 
was doing with Flash, because the next thing I knew, I was given the 
opportunity to produce animation, for showcase at a major school event 
(the anniversary of my Primary School, or something like that). I 
didn’t end up feeling proud of the animation that I would eventually 
make, but even till today, I am still pleased and flattered that I got 
“talent-spotted”, in a way.

<p>Comedy (as well as a sense of humour, if I may say so myself). My research includes
  watching episodes of Seinfeld, and reading manga. I hope their comedic effects are something I can absorb.

<p>I get reminders to avoid becoming arrogant, when I read the Bible. 
One passage reads: "if anyone thinks himself wise in this age, let him
 become a fool, so that he may gain wisdom." So, I'm quite happy to 
think of myself as a fool, if only so that I can seek wisdom.

<p>The artist Sophie Kao once said to me, "Even if you can
make your artwork look like a famous artist's artwork, 
what is the point of that? Art is about opening a door inside yourself, seeing
things in a new way."

<p>The Bible is important to me. (I read it every day.) I've 
found the Biblical book of Proverbs helpful, and so are the Psalms and the (Biblical) book of 
Ecclesiastes. 
As for more secular stuff, I've felt encouraged by Robert Frost's poem, titled "The road not taken". 
I've also benefited from a book titled "Not Knowing: The Art of Turning Uncertainty Into Opportunity", by Diana Renner and Steven D'Souza.
