<h3>
The wondrous works my god has done in my life

<li>In late 2013 A.D. or early 2014, I was alone at night on a long stretch of road. Before I knew it, I had a pack of dogs, which lined
themselves down the road, barking at me. I did not see how I could leave. Just when I thought I was in a terrible situation,
a stranger came by in a car. I waved to him and miraculously, that stranger stopped for me and let me in. I thank my god for that rescue.
That stranger would drop me off in a place that was better-lit (by street-lamps), and did not charge me any money for the ride.
