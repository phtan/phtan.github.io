<h3>What am I doing now?
</h3>

<p>I haven't painted much recently; I've been busy with learning skills 
  in piano performance, latte art, ceramics, and most importantly, how to be happy.
</p>
  <p>
    And I've been reading a lot of ancient Buddhist texts, helpfully translated from 
    Pali language into English. Such as the one 
    <a href="https://www.ancient-buddhist-texts.net/English-Texts/Great-Emancipation/03-Prevent-Community-Decline-1.htm">there.
      
    </a>
  </p>
</p>
  <p>What else am I doing with my time? I am hoping to channel my anger and frustration 
    and bitterness about the climate crisis into concrete constructive action, instead 
    of boiling myself alive with rage, while thumbing through "news websites".
    
    To that end, I've gotten a part-time job at <a href="https://www.realfoodgrocer.com/">an eatery near me</a>, that sells delicious organic vegetarian food 
  </p>
    
  <p>And, on weekends, I'm busy with attending to fellow 
    church-goers, at <a href="https://cathedral.org.sg/">a historic building</a>.
