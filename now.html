<h3>What am I doing now?
</h3>

  <p>In my free time, I enjoy taking photos.
</p>
<p>  
 And I feel delighted to know that some individuals have enjoyed my pictures 
  so much that they sent me money. It's not a 
  million dollars, but significant enough for me.
</p>
  <p>
You can definitely take a look:

  <p>What else am I doing with my time? I am 
    hoping to encourage more people to eat
    organic food - and not only organic food, but organic vegetarian food - through my 
    part-time job at <a href="https://www.realfoodgrocer.com/">my friend's eatery</a>.
  </p>
  <p>And, on weekends, I'm busy with attending to fellow 
    church-goers, at <a href="https://cathedral.org.sg/">a historic building</a>.
