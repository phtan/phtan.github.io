<h3>What am I doing now?
</h3>



<p>
I am about three months into
 <a href="https://www.tionghoe.com">my job</a> as a (part-time) barista.
</p>
<p>
My managers are supportive and understanding, and I am grateful for that. For example, they believed me when I said that some customers are just difficult to handle.
</p>
<p>
And I am getting involved in more activities at 
<a href = "https://cathedral.org.sg/">church</a>. For example, I assist with the audio-visual equipment - like PowerPoint slides - on some Saturdays, when a pastor preaches to a congregation of elderly people (in Hokkien language).
</p>
<p>
I do feel a sense of community in my above-mentioned efforts, and I thank God for that. 
It is easy for me to feel a sense of isolation, so tending to the above-mentioned efforts does help me feel more connected to humanity.
