<h3>What am I doing now?
</h3>



<p>
I've worked as a part-time barista for the 
past nine months or so.

But I have resigned, to protect my mental health.
I felt highly stressed at work, and I wondered: "is all this stress and misery 
necessary in my life?"

I plan to take a break from conventional employment. 
I've contributed to society, through my barista-job, 
and now I need to rest.
