<h3>What am I doing now?
</h3>


<p>I've been honing my piano skills, on public pianos. Hopefully it's a win-win 
  situation where the people around me feel 
  better after hearing 
  <a href="https://soundcloud.com/bingxiong-chen">some music</a>.
</p>
  <p>And, I've been maintaining and supporting a  
    at <a href="https://linktr.ee/strangerconvos">communal "living room".</a>
     For example, by sweeping the floor.
  </p>

<p>I haven't been painting much recently; I've been busy with learning skills 
  in <a href="https://m.soundcloud.com/bingxiong-chen/i-cling-on-to-hope-during-a-dark-night">
       piano performance </a>, 
  <a href="https://i.snap.as/sQnFyQDw.jpg">
    latte art</a>, 
  <a href="https://i.snap.as/nMEC9SQo.jpg">
    ceramics
  </a>, and most importantly, how to be happy.
</p>
  <p>
    And I've read a lot of ancient Buddhist texts, helpfully translated from 
    Pali language into English. Such as the one 
    <a href="https://www.ancient-buddhist-texts.net/English-Texts/Great-Emancipation/03-Prevent-Community-Decline-1.htm">there.
      
    </a>
  </p>
</p>
  <p>I am hoping to channel my anger and frustration 
    and bitterness about the climate crisis into concrete constructive action, instead 
    of boiling myself alive with rage, while thumbing through "news websites".
    
    To that end, I've gotten a part-time job at <a href="https://www.realfoodgrocer.com/">an eatery near me</a>, that sells delicious organic vegetarian food 
  </p>
    
  <p>And, on some weekends of the month, I attend to fellow 
    church-goers, at <a href="https://cathedral.org.sg/">a historic building</a>.
