<h3>What am I doing now?
</h3>

<p>I list three things I want to focus on,
at this point in my life.
<p>

<p>1. Completing a 
<a href="https://write.as/phtan/reading-challenge-2022">Reading Challenge</a>.

</p>

<p>2. Undergoing 
<a href="https://thepsychpractice.com/">psychotherapy</a>, in 
the hopes that I can lead a better and more fulfilling life, and 
tap any unexpressed potential. 
(And I thank a Biblical God that a kind Christian lady has offered 
to pay for my appointments with a therapist.)
</p>
<p>
3.Getting to know the music-and-arts scene in Singapore.
</p>
<p>
It seems like a lot of people in the industry feel like no one is paying attention to them.

When I do show up at their events, they tell me they are grateful for my presence.
</p>

<p> These people include:

<a href="https://mixmag.net/read/tune-in-24-hour-livestream-support-singapore-nightlife-asia-news">DJs</a>, 

film producers, set designers, singer-songwriters, and so on.
