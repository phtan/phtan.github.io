<h3>What am I doing now?
</h3>

  <p>I am witnessing how God fulfils Biblical prophecies. For example, Lord Jesus Christ predicted that
    "the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven". (Gospel of Matthew, Chapter 24, Verse 30).
    Who is this "Son of Man"? Well, 
Lord Jesus calls himself the "Son of Man" (as written in many parts of the Bible). True enough, on 21st of December 2020, Jupiter and Saturn appeared close together in the evening sky
    (from our point of view on Earth). In many news reports, this occurrence - called a conjunction - also had
    the name of "Christmas Star".
    
  </p>
  
  <p>So, what now?
</p>

  <p>From a Biblical perspective, I am called to
serve mankind, and to "go and make disciples of all nations". (
<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2028%3A19-20&version=NIV">
The gospel of Matthew, Chapter 28, Verses 19 and 20</a>).
</p>
 
<p>If anyone - or, say, someone named Cathy - asks me whether God is willing to forgive Cathy
  for Cathy's sins, I would say, "Yes, God wants you to be His child, Cathy. He wants to be your God.
  He loves you so much, that He has prepared His own son to die in your place, for the sins you
  have done. (The outcome of sin is death). But if we accept Lord Christ Jesus's sacrifice for us
  (and call Jesus our Lord), 
  and - with a faith that can be as small as a mustard seed - believe that God has raised Lord Jesus
  from the dead, we will be saved. We will be in a loving relationship with God. Of course, we must sin no
  more, and ask God what kind of life He wants us to lead from now on. And we must do His will, not just hear it."
  </p>
  
  <p>God says, "And you will seek Me and find Me, when you search for Me with all your heart." 
    (the book of Jeremiah, in the Bible. Chapter 29, Verse 13). Will Cathy return to God?
    This God has knitted Cathy together while she was in her mother's womb. I implore Cathy to be
    reconciled to God (while God's patience remains).
  </p>

<p>What else am I doing?
</p>

<p>
I am participating in an exchange of language and culture, with international people, as part of the organisation Mundo Lingo. Part of my work is moderating - and kick-starting - discussions in a (online) chat-group about Japanese language and culture. (This challenges me to improve my mastery of the Japanese language).
</p>

<p>I do not ask for a salary for my work with Mundo Lingo - in my limited knowledge, nobody in Mundo Lingo gets a salary - but I do feel rewarded with friendships and what internationals share with me, about their home culture and language.
