<h3>What am I doing now?
</h3>

<p>Earlier this month, I applied for an award worth SGD$15,000
to $20,000. (It is called "IMPART Award 2021", and the organisation behind
it is "Art Outreach"). The award supports emerging artists.
</p>

<p>The release of the results (of applications) is scheduled for
end-December 2020, if not early January 2021.
</p>

<p>So right now I am waiting for the results.
</p>

<p>I have joined online chat-groups that relate to my interests: language and cultural
exchange (the chat-group is called 
<a href="https://t.me/ML_Singapore">Mundo Lingo</a>), and software development 
(<a href="https://t.me/joinchat/AMjNsFh9UGJ9v56sF4KPjg">DevSg</a>), just
to name a few.
</p>

<p>In this way, I have Internet-users whom I can serve. For example,
I've met a lady from Myanmar, who has early-stage breast cancer. I hope
my presence in her (online) life comforts her and cheers her up.
</p>

<p>In a video posted on LinkedIn, a CEO of a publishing company (Ms. 
Juliana Chan of Wildtype Media) highlighted social capital and how it 
differs from financial capital.
</p>

<p>So one could say I'm gathering social capital, in my time within
these online chat-groups. From a Biblical perspective, I am called to
serve mankind, and to "go and make disciples of all nations". (

The gospel of Matthew, Chapter 28, Verses 19 and 20</a>).
