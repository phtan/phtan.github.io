<h3>What am I doing now?
</h3>


<p>
Right now, I am participating in an exchange of language and culture, with international people, as part of the organisation Mundo Lingo.
</p>
<p>
Mundo Lingo has a presence in many cities, and in light of the pandemic, we have moved from in-person gatherings to online chat-groups.
</p>
<p>
I do not ask for a salary for my work with Mundo Lingo - in my limited knowledge, nobody in Mundo Lingo gets a salary - but I do feel rewarded with friendships and what internationals share with me, about their home culture and language. (You may already know that I am teaching Singlish, or Singapore-flavoured English language, to at least one Burmese lady, as part of such work).
</p>
<p>
I believe in continuing education - in the hopes of learning the Indonesian 
language, I've been having weekly chats with an England-based Indonesian, 
over the Internet. (One hour each time).
</p>
<p>
On 30th August 2020, I completed an online course, "Writing in the sciences", 
which is from Stanford University. It has taken me eight weeks 
and despite its name, I've found it helpful in improving my everyday language. 
(<a href="https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/B4KUFQ86VYVX">Here 
is my certificate</a> - which cost USD$79 - if you're into that kind of thing.)
</p>
<p>
A good friend from Mundo Lingo, whom I shall call T - we've only ever met 
over the Internet - said that T has early-stage breast cancer.
</p>
<p>T is only thirty-two years old, but T has high spirits in such a time,
which I thank God for.
</p>
<p>T has a schedule of cancer-treatment to follow, for at least
one year (starting from now).
</p>
<p>I want to support T - in emotional and spiritual terms, at 
least - but first I have to take care of myself. I got some advice to care
for myself before caring for others.
</p>
<p>So I've been giving myself permission to enjoy myself: wine, movies, 
books, classical music (such as Requiem(s) by various composers).
