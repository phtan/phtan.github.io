<h3>What am I doing now?
</h3>

  <p>I am witnessing how God fulfils Biblical prophecies. For example, Lord Jesus Christ predicted that
    "the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven". (Gospel of Matthew, Chapter 24, Verse 30).
    True enough, on 21st of December 2020, Jupiter and Saturn appeared close together in the evening sky
    (from our point of view on Earth). In many news reports, this occurrence - called a conjunction - also had
    the name of "Christmas Star".
    
  </p>
  
  <p>So, what now?
</p>

  <p>From a Biblical perspective, I am called to
serve mankind, and to "go and make disciples of all nations". (
<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2028%3A19-20&version=NIV">
The gospel of Matthew, Chapter 28, Verses 19 and 20</a>).
</p>
 
<p>If anyone - or, say, someone named Cathy - asks me whether God is willing to forgive Cathy
  for Cathy's sins, I would say, "Yes, God wants you to be His child, Cathy. He wants to be your God.
  He loves you so much, that He has prepared His own son to die in your place, for the sins you
  have done. (The outcome of sin is death). But if we accept Lord Christ Jesus's sacrifice for us
  (and call Jesus our Lord), 
  and - with a faith that can be as small as a mustard seed - believe that God has raised Lord Jesus
  from the dead, we will be saved. We will be in a loving relationship with God. Of course, we must sin no
  more, and ask God what kind of life He wants us to lead from now on. And we must do His will, not just hear it."
  </p>
  
  <p>God says, "Seek me with all your heart, and you will find me." (According to the Bible). Will Cathy return to God,
    who knitted her together - head, fingers, toes and all - while she was in her mother's womb? I implore Cathy to be
    reconciled to God (while God's patience remains).
