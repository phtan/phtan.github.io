<h3>What am I doing now?
</h3>



<p>I'm giving thanks every day, or practising
gratitude. It helps me feel better.
</p>
<p>Sometimes I post about it 
<a href="http://twitter.com/tanphengheong">on Twitter.</a>
</p>
<p>

And I'm moderating and kick-starting discussions in a (online) chat-group 
about Japanese language and culture. (Under the organisation called Mundo Lingo).
</p>
 <p>
This challenges me to improve my mastery of the Japanese language.
</p>

<p>
I'm deciding if I want to continue (ad-hoc)
work at a hospital. The name of my job is "sitter", and I attend to patients, 
and help nurses out. Circumstances related to Covid - and people's reactions to Covid - give me pause.
</p>

<p>Recently I've made effort to figure out what people want
in such times. Trying to build - or cultivate - reciprocal relationships.
