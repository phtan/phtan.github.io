<h3>What am I doing now?
</h3>

  <p>
  I'm trying to support the next few generations, at  
    
    <a href="https://cathedral.org.sg/">church</a>.
    
</p>
  <p>
I'm turning 33 years old this year, and my body is letting me know that it is ageing, and 
    breaking down.
</p>
  <p>
I have to take care of the children of the future, who will inherit this planet.
  </p>
  <p>
    And, in my free time, I enjoy taking photos.
</p>
<p>  
 I feel delighted to know that some individuals have enjoyed my pictures 
  so much that they sent me money. It's not a 
  million dollars, but significant enough for me.
