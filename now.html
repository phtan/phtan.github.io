<h3>What am I doing now?
</h3>






<p>
I'm doing great.
</p>
<p>
I got baptised at 
<a href="https://cathedral.org.sg">
a church</a> earlier this year.
</p>
<p>
And other Christians have supported me, such as offering me jobs.

 In fact, I took up a job from them, as an assistant to nurses, at a hospital.
</p>
<p>
But the Covid restrictions are harsh right now, so I plan to take a break until August 2022, to see if the authorities change the restrictions
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, I'm selling some pictures I made:

<p>
And I've been reading the books I've wanted to, but have never gotten around to.
</p>
<p>
I got sick of the "social media" aspects of Goodreads.com (such as Likes and Follows), so I just made a HTML file to track my reading instead:

<p>Here's something I've been thinking about: what people want
in such times. Trying to build - or cultivate - reciprocal relationships.
