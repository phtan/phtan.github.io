<h3>What am I doing now?
</h3>



<p>I'm giving thanks every day, or practising
gratitude. It helps me feel better.
</p>
<p>Sometimes I post about it 
<a href="http://twitter.com/tanphengheong">on Twitter.</a>
</p>
<p>

And I am participating in an exchange of language and culture, with international people, as part of the organisation Mundo Lingo. Part of my work is moderating - and kick-starting - discussions in a (online) chat-group about Japanese language and culture.
</p>
 <p>
This challenges me to improve my mastery of the Japanese language.
</p>

<p>I do not ask for a salary for my work with Mundo Lingo - in my limited knowledge, nobody in Mundo Lingo gets a salary - but I do feel rewarded with friendships and what internationals share with me, about their home culture and language.
</p>

<p>What else am I doing?
</p>

  <p>From a Biblical perspective, I am called to
serve mankind, and to "go and make disciples of all nations". (
<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2028%3A19-20&version=NIV">
The gospel of Matthew, Chapter 28, Verses 19 and 20</a>).
</p>

  <p>(I am especially bold to do so, after witnessing how God fulfils Biblical prophecies. For example, Lord Jesus Christ predicted that
    "the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven". (Gospel of Matthew, Chapter 24, Verse 30).
    Who is this "Son of Man"? Well, 
Lord Jesus calls himself the "Son of Man" (as written in many parts of the Bible). True enough, on 21st of December 2020, Jupiter and Saturn appeared close together in the evening sky
    (from our point of view on Earth). In many news reports, this occurrence - called a conjunction - also had
    the name of "Christmas Star".)
    
  </p>
<p>But I have learnt the hard way that I have to 
be considerate to others when preaching the gospel.
