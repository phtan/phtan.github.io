<h3>What am I doing now?
</h3>



<p>
Honestly speaking, it takes effort, but I can still see blessings in my life.

</p>
<p>
It was a great comfort for me to meet a fellow Christian (in early 2021) - we are siblings-in-Christ - and I always thank God for that.

</p>

<p>

(You may think that there are a lot of Christians in the world, so meeting another Christian is no big deal, but I've found that it is rare to meet a like-minded Christian. I shall not mention the so-called "Christians" who sexually abuse children.)

</p>

<p>

As for jobs - nowadays, people whom I respect say they want to take care of themselves, instead of working at jobs that they dread. 

For example, the famous sports-woman, Simone Biles, made big waves in the Internet world when she withdrew from sports-events to take care of her own health. A lot of people scoffed at her.

</p>
<p>
I agree with people like Simone Biles. They inspire me. One has to be responsible for taking care of oneself. You have to be the one who puts your needs first on your list of priorities; no one else is going to do it for you.

</p>



<p>
Well, the way I see it, as long as I am healthy and happy - and as long as God loves me - I don't have to care what other people say. It certainly helps to have some independence from other people's opinions.

</p>
<p>
So I'm just giving myself permission to enjoy life: 
<ul>
<li>watching the movies I've always wanted to watch, 
</li>
<li>sipping coffee made of beans from all over the world,
</li>
<li> going for a leisurely walk in pretty parts of town, 
</li>

</ul>
and so on.
</p>
<p>

I hope you can find your own happiness as well.

</p>
