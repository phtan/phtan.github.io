<h3>What am I doing now?
</h3>






<p>
I took a break from 
<a href="https://joinmastodon.org">Mastodon</a> as well, from 29 March (2021) to 29 June.
</p>
<p>
Eventually I went back for the people.
</p>
<p>
I've been reading the books I've wanted to, but have never gotten around to.
</p>
<p>
And I got sick of the "social media" aspects of Goodreads.com (such as Likes and Follows), so I just made a HTML file to track my reading instead:

</p>

<p>

I'm moderating and kick-starting discussions in a (online) chat-group 
about Japanese language and culture. (Under the organisation called Mundo Lingo).
</p>
 <p>
This challenges me to improve my mastery of the Japanese language.
</p>

<p>Recently I've made effort to figure out what people want
in such times. Trying to build - or cultivate - reciprocal relationships.
