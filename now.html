<h3>What am I doing now?
</h3>


<p>I've been honing my piano skills, on public pianos. Hopefully it's a win-win 
  situation where the people around me feel 
  better after hearing 
  <a href="https://soundcloud.com/bingxiong-chen">some music</a>.
</p>
  <p>and I have been exploring a career in acting.
 Slowly but surely finding a way forward. 
    I love theatre, however gigs for the screen are paying my bills (for now).
    
  </p> <p>
 I realised that I have to be selective about scripts though.

Some just promote a situation that is contrary to my chosen values
</p>

<p>I haven't been painting much recently; I've been busy with learning skills 
  in <a href="https://m.soundcloud.com/bingxiong-chen/i-cling-on-to-hope-during-a-dark-night">
       piano performance </a>, 
  <a href="https://i.snap.as/sQnFyQDw.jpg">
    latte art</a>, 
  <a href="https://i.snap.as/nMEC9SQo.jpg">
    ceramics
  </a>, and most importantly, how to be happy.
</p>
  <p>
    And I've read a lot of ancient Buddhist texts, helpfully translated from 
    Pali language into English. Such as the one 
    <a href="https://www.ancient-buddhist-texts.net/English-Texts/Great-Emancipation/03-Prevent-Community-Decline-1.htm">there.
      
    </a>
  </p>
</p>
  <p>I am hoping to channel my anger and frustration 
    and bitterness about the climate crisis into concrete constructive action, instead 
    of boiling myself alive with rage, while thumbing through "news websites".
    
    To that end, I've gotten a part-time job at <a href="https://www.realfoodgrocer.com/">an eatery near me</a>, that sells delicious organic vegetarian food 
  </p>
    
  <p>And, on some weekends of the month, I attend to fellow 
    church-goers, at <a href="https://cathedral.org.sg/">a historic building</a>.
