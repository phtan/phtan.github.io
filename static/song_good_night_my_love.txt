## Draft 2

Ten nights have passed since I last saw you
This morning looks so sunny
Walking next to strangers,
I want to see you again

I know you had a younger man beside you, at work
Did you know, I myself had a younger woman beside me, at dinner
A mist stops me from seeing your silhouette on the pink horizon
but my voice was silent, I don't know why

Someone plays Beethoven's music in the background
nobody knows who Elise is
like how nobody knows who you are
anyway, how does Elise see Beethoven, did you ever wonder?

thank you,
thank you for loving me
now I know
even worms can taste happiness
as they die in the darkness.

thank you,
and I love you

 ## Draft 1

Ten nights have passed since I last saw you
A comet lit up the sky last night, did you see it?
This morning looks so sunny
~~And~~ as I sit on a crowded bus,
next to strangers, 
I wonder what you are doing
I want to see you again
Do you want to see me too?

I know you had a younger man beside you, at work
But I kept quiet <!--more-->
And I had a younger woman beside me, at dinner
But I never told you
A mist stops me from seeing your silhouette on the pink horizon
I wanted to say, "stop! stay with me for a while longer!"
but my voice was silent, I don't know why
What are we, really?

Someone plays Beethoven's music in the background
And I think to myself,
nobody knows who Elise is, in his famous dedication
It is better this way, then
Nobody knows who you are
in my songs
~~How does Elise see Beethoven?~~ 
What kind of Beethoven does Elise see? I wonder to myself.
And what is my reflection in your eyes?

thank you, 
I guess that's what I want to say
thank you for loving me
though I am a worm and not a man
But now I know
even a worm can feel happy and loved
and even worms can taste happiness
as they crawl in the dirt
and die in the darkness, 
forgotten by passing-by humans of yesterday and tomorrow

thank you,
and I love you
