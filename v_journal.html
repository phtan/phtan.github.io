<p>An art therapist recommended that I make a visual journal. Elaborating on what such a journal was, she said to
write down what my artwork was about, or, if I am not mistaken in my recollection, my thoughts and/or feelings 
at the point in time that I made my artwork. She said that it would be a record for my own reference in the future.

<p>I chose to make my visual journal public. Since December 2017, I have made it available at the following URL:
