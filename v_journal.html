If you are interested, I am selling my original visual works online, at

<p>In the year 2017 A.D., an 
  <a href="https://mira-yoon.format.com/">art therapist</a> recommended that I make a visual journal. Elaborating on what such a journal was, she said to
write down what my artwork was about, or, if I am not mistaken in my recollection, my thoughts and/or feelings 
at the point in time that I made my artwork. She said that it would be a record for my own reference in the future.

<p>I chose to make my visual journal public at the following URL:
