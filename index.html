 Fear the Lord G!D. That is all you need to know. (Proverbs 1:7) <br/>
 But fools despise instruction and wisdom.

 In the Quran, it is written: 'Take Sadaqah (alms) from their wealth in order to purify them and sanctify them with it, and invoke Allah for them. Verily! Your invocations are a source of security for them, and Allah is All-Hearer, All-Knower.'

 With the help of the LORD G!D, who is Most Merciful, I've contributed to the following projects:
 <ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/Tatoeba/tatoeba2">Tatoeba</a>. My commits are <a href="https://github.com/Tatoeba/tatoeba2/commits/dev?author=phtan">there</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/gogits/gogs">Gogs</a>. G!D forbid that I glory in myself, save only in the cross of Christ Jesus. And yet, if G!D is willing, you may find my commits <a href="https://github.com/gogits/gogs/commits/master?author=phtan">there</a>.</li>

 To you who think you have 'mental illness', and are trying to 'control' that with abominations that are man-made, the Bible has a 
 verse, oh the G!D-breathed Word that is suitable for rebuking and disciplining so that you are wise for salvation through
 the Christ: 'A house divided cannot stand'
</p>

<p>
 
 On people who are involved with the death penalty: executioner, legal procedure people. The Bible has said, 'Put away your swords,
 For those who live by the sword will die by the sword.' <br/> And that is supposedly a gift from the Lord Christ Jesus. 'Those who have
 Ears, let them hear,â€™goes another part of the Bible.
 </p>

 Now when Jesus was asked 
 'Are you Son of G!d'
 Jesus said 
 'It is as you say. Furthermore, I tell you now that I am resurrecting in three days after my death,
 by the power given me by my Father in Heaven'
 'Blasphemy,' they said, sending Jesus to crucifixion 
 (Thy will be done on Heaven, and thy will be done on earth as on Heaven. O blessed are you, Father in Heaven, King of the Universe, Ruler of Heaven. Hallowed be thy name.)
 Apostle Paul said,
 'My execution of Christians was before the Lord Christ Jesus appeared to me, saying, 'Why are you killing me?'
 Now, conscience of mine, it is clear before G!d and man.'
 It is written in the Bible, 'Christ- the Christ lives in me.'
 And it written in the Bible. What? Paul was preaching to people who heard him, but they began leaving 
 After hearing him say. What?
 You hear always but do not understand

 Routine that is awkward and painful is no longer music to my ears /
 Often, people don't always take care of themselves /
 Why don't they love themselves /
 Birds came in, red /
 and purple too /
 That's what they turned my skin into /
 Ain't that a sharp pain there /
 Oh, why do they hurt me so /
 My kiss to them /
 Lets my blood out /
 They continue chirping /
 Perhaps this is the time /
 to say it's- /
 o /
 it's not okay /
 why do my tears flow /
 oh, joy /
 ow /
 it's time to die, the birds say /
 death-songs come softly /
 please forgive them, Heavenly Compassionate Father /
 Boom
