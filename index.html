  About me in a few words
  </b>
  </p>
  <p>
In March 2018, I left my undergraduate-studies in Computer Science, even
 though it was my Final Year of the course of study. I just didn't 
 believe anymore in what I was doing. I wasn't enjoying my time, and it 
 was taking a toll on my mental health. So, I left.
</p>
<p>
Here's part of my beliefs:
<ul>
<li>I can enjoy myself, and serve society/mankind at the same time
</li>
<li>I can be contented with my material lifestyle (eg. What to eat, what to drink, what to wear).
</li>
</ul>
  </p>
  
  <p><b>What am I working on now?
