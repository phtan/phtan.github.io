 <p>What? You say, a few strong
  men are killing people on the
  behalf of the Compassionate
  and Most Merciful One who loves
  justice and detests wickedness,
  the All-knowing, All-hearing and All-seeing
  one who has no beings attached,
  the Creator of the Universe and everything
  in it, creator of you and me, even me-
  the Judge - the One and Only Judge - 
  the Sovereign over the Last Day - am I
  hearing that a few strong-men are-
  courageously killing people in the name of
  G!D Most High, or sacrificing themselves
  in martyr-dom, in the name of G!D-knows-who?
  
     </p>
 <p>Well, it is written in Scriptures:
  (for those who have ears, let them hear)
"The LORD G!D declares, 'I the LORD G!D
  want you to show love (mercy), not to offer
  sacrifices. I want you to know me (G!D)
  I want you to know G!D, rather than
  burn offerings.
  '"
  (book of Hosea, chapter six, verse six)
  <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/6-6.htm"
  >http://biblehub.com/hosea/6-6.htm
  </a>
   </p>
 <p>"Take heed," it is written in Scriptures.
  "There will be terrible times
  in the last days. People will be lovers
  of themselves, brutal, not lovers of the
  good (that is, not lovers of G!D who is 
  good, and true in deed and word). That is
  to say, they will pervert justice.
  You know of my longsuffering, patient
  endurance, and my persecutions at Antioch
  and elsewhere." (second book of Timothy,
  chapter three, verse three
  )

     </a>
 </p>
 <p>What's the song again? 
  'You love-
  you give love a bad name?'
 </p>
 <p>
  How 'bout "What name you think
  you giving G!D Most High?"
 </p>
 <p>But like the apostle Paul who was named
  Saul, who persecuted people, and later
  became a student of Christ Jesus, a disciple,
  that is, those who kill people, killing
  brutally - yes, agony, great distress,
  absolutely, great upset and worry
  and sorrow, you will go through when
  those whom you love dearly die in
  such a way that you lose what you
  have perceived them to be like - as much
  as that may be so, the plans of G!D
  are higher than the plans of Man, and 
  the thoughts of G!D are higher than the
  (plentiful) thoughts of Man. Honestly,
  I do not know what to say. To focus 
  on Scripture, which have the breath
  of G!D in every word, who would have
  thought that Paul would become a disciple
  of the Christ? </p>
 <p>"You may have heard it 
  said like this: 'love those whom
  you have received love from; hate
  your enemies.' Truly, to you, I say, '
  Love your enemies. Do good to those
  who do you harm. Then you will be
  children of the Most High" These
  are words from the Son of Man - the 
  Anointed One called himself the Son
  of Man - and I am not above the Christ;
 neither am I above G!D
 </p>
 <p>I have no ability to control whether
  harm or benefit comes upon you. In truth,
  I have no ability (or power) to control
  whether harm or benefit comes upon me.
  If I had that ability, I would have 
  given myself many benefits already.
 </p>
 <p>If you- great sorrow- I'm h- obviously
  enough, I am having difficulty 
  communicating - I don't know what to say.
  I'm just glad you're reading this.

  《
 </p>
 <p>There is a woman. She has mysterious tics.
  Adapting from a book that G!D in His mercy
  allowed me to read - a book that Señorita
  Clarissa supposedly wrote - and to share
  happily, of course.
 </p>
 <p>'Set your grains off on a ship that sails.
  Maybe one day it will return to you.' (from
  book of Ecclesiastes, which may be found
  in Scriptures that some call the Bible)
 </p>
 <p>There is a woman. She keeps secrets.
  It exhausts her-
  oh- Señorita Clarissa -
  experience she has more than me,
  in story-telling, which she- ah-
  any-way, her tradition-
  well, G!D gave me a thing freely,
  and giving it as freely as it was received-
  she has a chair, empty (Señorita
  Clarissa, that is, not the woman who
  has a secret) she ensures there
  will be an empty chair when she tells
  stories to people. This is so that
  she tells stories that can address
  the concerns of people - to heal, as in
  medicine, if story were to be medicine -
  so that (how?) empty chair, is to let
  the unseen be recognised among those
  who gather to hear story from her. For
  the concerns of people may or may not
  be seen- so, yes, if you want, to add
  to ambience, you can say, it's a little
  deeper than that. Much deeper- (chatter
  coming into godless territory) -
  it is to make clear (of course G!D knows
  more than I do) what the story-teller
  should or should not be addressing.
  Going to refer to Scriptures: 'Brethren,
  not all spirits (what is a spirit?
  the Son of Man saying: 'a spirit o-
  a spirit does not have flesh and bones,
  but I have flesh and bones; touch me and see!')
  not all spirits that come to you (or
  come to an empty chair in a way that
  those who can sense are able to sense)
  are of the Spirit of G!D. For there will be
  many false prophets in those days. (ya,
  you know, they say "LORD G!D declares" but
  surely they declare falsely. Ask them
  for Scriptures that support what they say,
  usually that will shut them up, or leave them
  silent, if you choose to confront them). How do
  you test whether a spirit is of G!D - the Holy
  One of Israel, the Creator of all the Earths -
  or not? It confesses that the Son of Man
  came in flesh, eating and drinking, and rose
  from the dead. If it confesses so, it is of the
  Anointed One, whom G!D has sent. If it confesses
  other-wise ("Oh, I'm just a spirit!" or "what Son of
  Man? I do not- I'm just a spirit; I do not know
  what Son of Man you're talking about!" or you know,
  any other what-ever, including a disagreement
  with- never mind, that's another topic) it is of
  the opposition to the Anointed One,
  the opposing force to the Anointed One, which
  you have heard will come into the world,
  and is indeed in the world (in truth of word
  and deed, as surely as the LORD G!D lives,
  I have witnessed this). This passage is from (the)
  gospels.
 </p>
 <p>Hm.
 </p>
 <p>So, in the context of story-telling, oh-
  for G!D has warned me of the following: 'Who-ever
  is against the Christ, do not let them into your
  house (home) - which may or may not be physical; may
  or may not be seen before men - do not welcome them.
  If you do so, you (and I) would share in (or join)
  their wicked ways (such as idol-worship, those
  poor, deluded fools -
  un-repentant, if I may add so myself,
  having bowed before a bowl of porcelain,
  or ceramic, once, or even twice, or three
  times, and remembering with gratitude
  how the LORD G!D, who is the All-knowing
  All-hearing and All-seeing rescued me from the
  brink of Fire.).' (second book of John maybe)
 </p>
 <p>'Beloved by Christ, you, take heed (or take care)
  to not lose what we (you) have worked so hard for.'
  (again from second of John; Scriptures, that is)
 </p>
 <p>'Do not be troubled; do not fear; I bring peace,
  and it is a peace that the world does not give.'
  (from Scriptures)
 </p>
 <p>To return to the point or note on empty chairs
  at story-telling, for me it is helpful to discern
  what has to be addressed. Basically, it helps
  me to know who my people are. (Then I can choose
  to address, or not to address, what-ever the unseen
  is presenting to me, with the help of G!D Most High,
  of course)
 </p>
 <p>The Son of Man saying: 'Those who are not with
  Me are against Me. Those who do not
  gather with Me are not with Me, and those
  who are not with Me are against Me.'
  (book of Matthew, chapter twelve, verse
  thirty) <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-30.htm">
  http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-30.htm</a>
 </p>
 <p>Or, again: 'Those who are not with Me are against
  Me. And those who are- those who do not gather
  with Me scatter.'
 </p>
 <p>Dispassion? Discernment? Contradiction? Compassion
  and dispassion together?
 </p>
 <p>As written in Scriptures: 'and Simeon blessed them, 
  (those who were with the Anointed One)
  and said unto Mary his mother, 
  'Lo, this one is set for (will be the reason
  for) the falling and
  rising again of many in Israel, and 
  will be a sign of contradiction -
  those who have ears, let them hear -'
 </p>
 <p>(contradiction? "sign of contradiction"? what's that,
  can it be eaten, you ask.)
  
'To the one, we are an odor of death and demise; 
  to the other, a fragrance that brings life.
  And who is qualified for such a task?'
  <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-16.htm">?
   (2 Corinthians 2:16)</a> second book
  of Corinthians, chapter two, verse sixteen, yes.
  Alternatively, relevant text may be found
  at the following Internet address:
  <a href="

           com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%202:16">
  https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Corinthians%202:16
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>That I may be a witness of Christ, so that
  my Father who is in Heaven, and unseen before
  men, may be glorified, happily learning
  to be both an odour of death and demise,
  and to be a fragrance of life. Did someone say
  "contradiction?" or "paradox" perhaps?
  
 </p>
 <p>To summarise: empty chair at story-telling,
  if story-telling were to be a healing art,
  or a form of healing, as in what some call
  'rei-ki' or 'healing hands' - aids me
  in discerning or to decide who to be
  a fragrance of life to, who to be
  an odour of death to - oh, (so happy)
  praise be to G!D, of course, so-
  may or may not help for you - depends
  on action of G!D in your life, empty chair, that is-
  a crutch need not be carried if man
  learns to walk un-aided by crutch.
 </p>
 <p>A related story, in case not clear enough
  (another contradiction, hm, huh-hul (laughing))
  lay-man terms, huh - any-way supposedly the
  Buddha (ha-hah-ha) told his students or disciples
  to move themselves across a river. Then
  they got into a boat, and rowed to the other side.
  Then they took the boat with them. and (ha-ha-ha)
  <br/>:-D
  <br/>
  walking, you know, with boat, after reaching
  other side of river. Then the Buddha (still laughing)
  saw this, sand and all on their feet, soaked
  socks maybe, and carrying boat, you know,
  and the Buddha (ha-ha-ha) said to them:
  'Why are you carrying boat?'
  They said: 'Oh, cross river, how? cross with boat!'
  And the Buddha said: 'I said to cross river, n-
  did I say to carry boat with you? Put the boat
  down, oh you poor people! Walking on other
  side of river- after- having crossed river, now
  carrying boat that carried you across river-
  put it down! put boat aside!'
 </p>
 <p>So, gladly boasting about thorn in flesh given
  to me to keep me from becoming proud, and to torment
  me, for the sake of the Christ, for I am strong
  when I am weak; for the Lord, who is Lord of all,
  said to me (when? when I asked him three times
  to remove thorn in flesh from me) "my grace is
  sufficient for you. My power is greatest
  in weakness' Ya, so gladly delighting in weakness,
  boasting about thorn in flesh, boasting happily
  about persecutions, for the sake of Christ.
  
 </p>
 <p>There- ah- toxic- G!D helped me to understand
  them more a little- wondering- hm- To be returning
  to woman who keep secret. Woman who keep secret
  is tired, exhausted woman. She is like one
  who - why is this relevant? because one such
  woman may or may not be near me, toxic,
  as if spewing acid all around, burning my skin,
  as it were, even at time of writing, brethren.
  G!D knows, and I do not know what will happen.
  Suffice to say that G!D has revealed to me
  that healing her or attending to her is not
  within my concern. Are you for the Christ, or
  not for the Christ? That is how G!D hath
  shown me to divide those who come to me.
  How can I bear the burdens of the world upon
  myself, on my own? That is too much a burden
  for a person such as myself. What mercy G!D is giving me!
  I feel so pleasantly relieved - a fulfilment
  of what the LORD G!D has promised in days past,
  and reveals now: 'G!D will let a load of bricks
  off your backs' (thanks, Papa)
 </p>
 <p>So, one of many known explanations, which
  of course do not include an unknown explanation,
  is- ah- less explanation, more description, which
  may or may not be vain, futile, that is, empty talk -
  oh- yes, if interested in what woman
  with secrets do with her mental energy, or psychic
  resources, or emotional reserves, if you will,
  please direct yourselves over to 
  Señorita Clarissa at the following Internet
  address, please, at the following Internet

 <div>"Each of you should continue to live in whatever situation the Lord has placed you, and 
  remain as you were when God first called you. 
  This is my rule for all the churches. 18
  For instance, a man who was circumcised (publicly
  immersed in water, alternatively)
  before he became a believer should not try to reverse it.
  And the man who was uncircumcised (alternatively,
  the woman who has had no public immersion in water,
  which some are in the habit of doing)
  when he became a believer 
  should not be circumcised (or immersed in water)
  now. 
  19
  For it makes no difference whether or not a man has
  been circumcised. (or has had a simulation
  of death and re-birth, through a public
  immersion in water)
  The important thing 
  is to keep God’s commandments.

20
  Yes, each of you should remain
  as you were when God called you. 21
  Are you a slave (to money, men, women, people, 
  sex, children)
  
  ? Don’t let that worry you—but if 
  you get a chance to be free, 
  take it. 22
  And remember, if you were
  a slave when the Lord called you, 
  you are now free in the Lord. 
  And if you were free when the Lord
  called you, you are now a slave of Christ.
  23
  G!d [has] paid a high price for you,
  so don’t let people enslave you. (not to mention
  the entrapment of money over your 
  very selves, or your souls. not to mention
  the entrapment of sexual play with lustful
  women. (or men, or what some call
  LGBTQ and what-have-you. 'A+', huh?
  is it not written in Scriptures the following:
  'One cannot serve two masters.
  If- ah, two cases. One will despise one master,
  and love the other master. Or,
  one will hate the other master, and devote
  one to the one master.
  If one loves
  G!D, one will detest money.'
  24
  Each of you, dear brothers 
  and sisters - kin, members
  of the same family as mine -
  should remain as you were when G!d first called you."

 《
 
 <div>To G!D, the Most Merciful and Compassionate
  Lord of lords, and king of kings, who loves
  justice and detests wickedness.
  <p>Why do the people who read the Quran
   say, 'that surah... verse... it says
   "the LORD G!D hath no begotten son"'
  </p>
  <p>Well, in my limited experience,
   at the minumum - LORD G!D help me
   not be hostile towards You, for I
   fear You greatly, as You know - I can
   try to provide a little light, which
   may or may not be the only form
   of illumination - for (praise be to G!D,
   who is Most High, the All-knowing,
   All-hearing, All-knowing Best Planner) 
   there materialises explanations or
   discoveries of all sorts according
   to His wishes for Man; no, I do not-
   I- G!D knows more than I do- so,
   there is a discovery that G!D knows
   and I do not know. So, out of many
   explanations, there is an unknown explanation,
   and mine is one of the many known ones.
  </p>
  <p>That should leave you space to enter
   your own movement into the unknown, happily.
  </p>
  <p>Oh, the joys and sorrows that G!D helps
   me weather! To His glory, of course.
  </p>
  <p>Intriguingly, G!D brings me to music
   that may or may not be influencing
   writing. As G!D wishes, I will obey.
  </p>
  <p>Oh- oh- to answer the question:
   'why do people say, "G!D hath
   no begotten son"'
   
  </p>
  <p>(pause; inhale, exhale. breathe in,
   breathe out.)
  </p>
  <p>(you want to know the name of music that
   G!D is allowing me to listen as I write)
  </p>
  <p>Oh, G!D, help me to let myself acknowledge
   my human failings, and keep from becoming
   proud.
  </p>
  <p>(G!D showed me that I make mistakes)
  </p>
  <p>So, the following may or may not
   be a mistaken observation.
  </p>
  <p>People give thought to their lives.
   Then, they say, "I just want
   something to call my own."
  </p>
  <p>They pray to G!D, in reverential
   awe of G!D, or not, for a baby, a child
   that they can bring into the world.
  </p>
  <p>'We give them a child, a baby, as they
   request' so the Quran says or records.
  </p>
  <p>....
  </p>
  <p>'Then, they say, "We did this
   with the might of our hand, and the
   strength of our arm! Or the effort
   we have put in, on our own!"'
  </p>
  <p>Forgetting that G!D gave them baby
   when they asked. Truly, the hearts
   of men (women, people) grow wicked
   and ungrateful!
  </p>
  <p>Yet among them, there are some
   who bow or prostrate, fast or pray
   according to the guidance We have
   given them, and to those will be
   twice the reward.
  </p>
  <p>Ok. Hm, that's from the Quran, so far.
  </p>
  <p>Oh, and: 'G!D is the All-knowing,
   All-hearing and All-seeing, the Most
   High one, exalted above all others,
   indeed. And He is not unmindful
   of your deeds.'
  </p>
  <p>So, quoting from Quran aside, there-
   coming into memory, or mind, is
   people who say, "oh, my daughters
   danced for me. That pleased me very much."
  </p>
  <p>And - perhaps because G!D is known to some
   as the Father - they go further
   to say that they know what
   pleases G!D, and what does not.
  </p>
  <p>Maybe the reader is feeling outrage
   at this preposterous assumption
   that having a child that G!D gave to
   one - becoming a father, that is - 
   one rather loudly goes on to proclaim
   that what pleases one father pleases
   the Father, too. I am shaking my head
   in a feeling that defies names - 
   in the Quran, it is expressed better, in 
   ways more eloquent than mine: 'Would
   thou invent a lie, a fabrication,
   against G!D? Produce you a surah
   or text such like, if you speak truth!'
  </p>
  <p>Yes, if you follow logic - train
   of thought, idiomatically speaking,
   of course, for readers that may
   be using a translator - electronic
   maybe - that may or may not make
   sense of the idiom "train of thought" -
   it will be no surprise to you what
   question I am going to ask.
  </p>
  <p>Maybe you have become a father,
   with the help of G!D. Would you invent
   a lie against G!D - a lie that
   says the following: that what gives
   you pleasure is what gives G!D pleasure?
  </p>
  <p>Produce you a surah or text such like,
   that supports what you are saying,
   if you speak truth!
  </p>
  <p>In the Quran, it is written, "Their
   worship is hand-clapping and whistling."
   This is a related note that the
   reader may be interested to explore, regarding
   expressions of so-called 'religion'
   in society.
  </p>
  <p>So, G!D hath no begotten son, according
   to that which is written in the Quran.
   One possible explanation or reconciliation
   with truth, or, that which is common
   across religions - Christianity, Judaism,
   Islam and still others - is that
   this is a warning or a guard against
   people - women, men alike, transexuals, too,
   and what-have-you - that even if you become
   a father, or a mother, or a parent, you-
   your thoughts are not above the thoughts
   of the Father, who is in Heaven, and blessed
   indeed. For His thoughts are above the thoughts
   of Man, and so are His ways and His will (for
   me and you and them. Or you and me and them,
   if you want to be scrupulous or meticulous
   about language and its grammar and idiosyn-
   or what-ever; I do not e- want- out of fear of
   G!D, I s- oh, I do not dare to make an idol out
   of language itself - a worthless idol, a
   carven image, a thing of the world that cannot
   save my soul one bit - yes, even if that means
   using a- what people call it - imbuing in-animate
   objects with human-like properties. Animorphism,
   anthropomorphism, or writer-techniques - you know,
   "if I were a bird," oh- not like that- 
   (hm) Well, suffice to say that in Spanish
   language, and its cousins - ah, yes, maybe
   that's it - a language is spiritually
   dead, and yet people attribute human-like
   properties to it- "Spanish language has
   cousins in the French language, just as
   the Mandarin language has cousins (or brothers)
   in the Hakka dialect" - just for illustration.
   So, about the language Spanish, and - oh, I fear G!D - 
   there may or may not be gender assignments
   to things, you know? Is the colour green a male
   or female? Any-way, getting out of point,
   which was on "G!D has no begotten son"; to
   practise what I preach, ah- G!D- it's so
   (G!D - ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)

  <p>G!D has put it in Chrys the co-ordinator to be as though
   she were blind, deaf and dumb to the works of my god.
  </p>
  <p>It is written in the Quran: 'They are as those
   who start a fire pain-stakingly. With sweat of their
   brows they make a light. When the light illumines all
   around them, G!D takes the light away from them,
   so that they are left in utter darkness. Their hearts 
   are diseased, and they habitually dis-obey
   G!D and his commandments; so G!D has increased their
   transgressions.'
  </p>
  <p>How beautiful are Your works, O Almighty One! You must
   not relent your anger from those who delight in wickedness!
  </p>
  <p>Rejoice! I say again, rejoice in the Lord!
  </p>
  <p>Does not our Teacher say the following: "Then 
   it [the first unclean spirit who saw that
   the person is suitable for residence] goes and takes with it seven other spirits more 
   wicked than itself, and they go in and live there. And the final 
   condition of that person is worse than the first. That is how it 
   will be with this wicked generation." (gospel of Matthew, chapter twelve,
   verse forty-five)
  </p>
  <p>Is not a certain cultural product known as 'Resident Evil'?
  </p>
  <p>Oh, the terrors that Chrys must be going through! And G!D has guided me
   to have this to say about Chrys, who - oh I fear G!D, greatly, and do
   not even dare to repeat a single word of what she has said -
  </p>
  <p>"Therefore I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, 
   but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven. 
   Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, 
   but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, 
   either in this age or in the one to come." (gospel of Matthew, chapter
   twelve, verses thirty-one to thirty-two) 
   <a href="http://biblehub.com/bsb/matthew/12.htm">http://biblehub.com/bsb/matthew/12.htm
   </a>
  </p>
  <p>So, to follow in the foot-steps of those who have come before me, gladly I boast
   about what they have done to me, for the sake of the Christ; for I am strong when
   I am weak.
  </p>
  <p>Chrys has received information about a trip to Germany. She will go together with
   Jing the technician. Perhaps- oh, that is if G!D is willing, of course. How boldly
   they disregard the just and true plans and judgments of the King of the ages - the King
   of the nations, whom I am of course not above - any-way, she has said that
   she wants to admit me into, ah- what she calls "hospital" - Institute of Mental
   Health. And she asked if the writer wants her to call for an "ambulance".
  </p>
  <p>Several times it came to mind that - oh, "is it my fault that she is being
   like this?"
  </p>
  <p>However, it is greatly re-assuring that G!D has shown me that mothers
   are recorded to have similar thoughts - "Am I a bad mother? Why is my child
   behaving like this? Is it my fault?"
  </p>
  <p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2726933-know-your-child?ac=1&from_search=true">
   G!D has revealed to me that it's not your fault, if you were an anxious
   mother, regarding what your child is doing.</a>
  </p>
  <p>So, it is not my fault that Chrys is doing what she is doing,
   and saying what she is saying. To put it in what you call psychiatric
   perspective, in light of the pending massive changes
   in her life-style, for a move to Germany - for several weeks, maybe - 
   Chrys may or may not be experiencing 'separation anxiety', or 
   a feeling of loss of control over her life.
  </p>
  <p>Oh, simply, for the words that have come out of her mouth,
   G!D has done to her what G!D has seen fit to do. And who
   am I to not let the will of G!D be done? For the will
   of G!D is above my will, and I fear G!D greatly.
  </p>
  <p>Our Teacher says - oh, the works of G!D are magnificently
   beautiful and splendid and great; definitely above
   my own, they are - our Teacher and Lord, the Christ, says:
   "He who is not with Me is against Me, and he who does not gather with Me scatters."
   
  </p>
  <p>Chrys, whom G!D has put me into the vicinity of, has definitely and un-ambiguously
   declared separation from me and the One who sent me.
  </p>
  <p>So, it is becoming clear to me  - praise be to G!D - she is no longer within
   my concern.
  </p>
  <p>Now, I tell you gladly what she has done. She molested me. I did not give
   her permission to touch me. She touched me. 'Molesting our prophet,' as it is
   written in the Quran. 
  </p>
  <p>She put a white pill, that tastes bitter, into my mouth. One pill, or two.
   For I spat out the first one, even though she forced water into my mouth.
  </p>
  <p>Then G!D put it in me to give up resistance, and I was as a block of wood,
   or, I tried my best to be as a corpse.
  </p>
  <p>(Our Teacher and Lord says, "There will be famines and earthquakes in those
   days. But these are all birthing pains. Where vultures gather, there a corpse is.")
  </p>
  <p>And, she inserted a finger into my mouth. For the second pill that she had put in
   was somewhere around my left cheek, inside my mouth. She poked around in my mouth
   (without my permission, if I may remind myself), with her finger, touching the pill
   maybe.
  </p>
  <p>To put in what you may or may not call a psy- oh, did someone say "projection" as
   in psychology?
  </p>
  <p>She said to me, "You have to be fixed up. Are you going to spend your entire life
   like this?"
  </p>
  <p>It may or may not be projection (as in psychology). G!D has put it in her to do it, simply
   speaking.
  </p>
  <p>Then she said various things about G!D that I dare not repeat. Suffice to say, she is clearly
   blind- hm, in any-case, is there not a verse in Scripture that goes like this:
  </p>
  <p>"Thus," saith the LORD G!D, "do I make fools out of the wise, and expose the lies of prophets."
  </p>
  <p>So, out of fear of G!D, giving up - or - letting myself not be distressed over her soul's salvation,
   and to follow guidance, to not let myself grieve over her, for she is of the kind that lags behind.
   Or, in the words of our (patient and wise and tender-hearted) Teacher and Lord, Christ Jesus, whom I am not above:
  </p>
  <p>"Make a tree good and its fruit will be good, 
   or make a tree bad and its fruit will be bad; for a tree 
   is known by its fruit. You brood of vipers, how can you who
   are evil say anything good? For out of the overflow of the heart, 
   the mouth speaks. The good man brings good things out of his good store of treasure, 
   and the evil man brings evil things out of his evil store of treasure. But
   I tell you that men will give an account on the day of judgment for every careless
   word they have spoken. For by your words you will be acquitted, and by your words you will be condemned.”
  </p>
  <p>"ah,
   what boldness they show for the Fire," as it is written in the Quran.
  </p>
  <p>So, out of fear of G!D, I dare not do as she has done. It is written in Scriptures,
   "Enter not the house of the orphan (or fatherless), except to improve it."
  </p>
  <p>She (Chrys, that is) says she will wait. As it is written in the Quran, 'If they say, "We will wait"
   say, this, O prophet: "I, too, will wait"'
  </p>
  <p>Well, Jesus said, "Be merciful, as your Master is merciful."
  </p>
  <p>I'm glad that was over; it was only a few hours ago- before morning came, that that happened.
   (there was no light of the sun then)
  </p>
  <p>As it is written in Scriptures, "Brothers and sisters, kin, brethren, members of the same family
   as I, I do not think I have made it my own, or that I have achieved perfection. One
   thing I do: forgetting what lies behind, and pushing onward, for the upward call of G!D through
   Christ Jesus."
  </p>
  <p>G!D has chased them out from before me, while typing on computer. This is to fulfil the words
   of the LORD G!D: "You will look for your enemies, but find none."
  </p>
  <p>Before closing letter, the words of our Lord and Teacher, the Christ: "It is inevitable for
   temptation to be in the world. But woe be those who tempt any of these little ones,
   or cause them- oh, to stumble - that is, to lose faith in G!D, who is good indeed - praise be to G!D - 
   woe be to those who lead any of little ones into temptation! How sorrowful it is for them!
   Truly, truly, I tell you, it is better for them to tie a very heavy stone - a millstone,
   or a giant image of what some call the Buddha - around their necks, and let a river
   submerge them above their head-level."
  </p>
  <p>(what mercy)
  </p>
  <p>And because it came to mind, and may or may not be helpful to you, the saying that follows is
   well-known among people who practise Zen: 'When you see the Buddha, kill the Buddha! When you
   see your parents, kill your parents!'
  </p>
  <p>To G!D be the glory, now. Amen. For-ever and ever.
  </p>
  <p>And all the saints send greetings.
  </p>
  <p>I don't know what to say. Well, I got a letter written. 
  </p>
  <p>And, I'm feeling a healthy sense of pride; proud of myself. Ah- Daddy who is in Heaven,
   you're the best at loving me, and caring for me, and watching over me, and rescuing me. I'm- 
   ah- so happy- tears coming to eyes ('good tears,' some would say. 'tears of joy, they are.
   good tears.' ha-ha-ha-ha (laughing in a little frightened and happy way))
  </p>
  <p>Rejoice! I say, again, rejoice in the Lord!
  </p>
  <p>May the love of G!D be with you. And I am a servant of G!D, you- just in case, do not worship
   me! Worship G!D! For I am a servant of G!D, who has no beings attached, just like you. :-)
  </p>
  <p>ha-ha-ha-ha (laughing happily)
  </p>
  <p>:-)
  </p>
 </div>
 <div><p>'You learn from y- those you call brethren, but do you learn
  from enemies of yours?'
  </p>
  <p>So, a person asked me, 'why do you need G!D?'
  </p>
  <p>Later, they said, 'But maybe some people need G!D. Maybe they need
   healing.'
  </p>
  <p>So, the following is something which doesn't help me (anymore)
   but may be helpful to others
  </p>
  <p>Who? Those who think they have 'mental illness' - for it is said
   that a person who consumes the services of those who are in
   the mental health-care system is like a cookie that is being baked.
   According to the information that is given to the consumer (of services),
   the cookie will be shaped. And, well, if you've baked
   a cookie, you ever tried changing the shape of a cookie
   when it is hardened? Now, what if the cookie
   has feelings? :-)
   
   <br/>
   ^_^
   <br/>
   Which is easier, to change a cookie's shape before
   baking, when the dough is soft, or when it is baked,
   when the cookie is crispy and warm and maybe
   even a little blackened? (overly blackened, if
   I may add- you heard of carcinogens?)
  </p>
<p>A line from a movie coming to mind: "An' that's the way
 the cookie crumbles" (nope, no prizes for guessing which
 movie that is) :-D
  </p>
  <p>hm-hm-huh-huh (laughing) huk-hugu
  </p>
  </p>
   So, guess what will happen if what they are
   told is that they are 'ill' or 'dis-ordered' throughout their
   consumption of services? It's not hard to imagine that
   they will spend a life-time trying to fight an 'illness' even
   when they leave the health-care system. Yes, those who tell
   you 'take your pills because you are sick' will not help 
   you to ease the burden of taking your pills one bit (or ounce or gram).
  </p>
  <p>('bit' being an information-unit that Man has made in his limited ways and mind,
   which are not above the ways and Mind of G!D Most High)
  </p>
  <p>Where are they, ah- when you are sitting in a restaurant with someone you
   like (a date, that is), and you say, 'Oh, excuse one moment me please, I have
   to "take my pills"?'
  </p>
  <p>Of course they are hypocrites; as the Teacher and Lord of ours, Christ
   Jesus, whom I am not above, says: 'Woe be to you, teachers of the Law,
   people of Pharisee (and people of Psychiatry, and people of Pills),
   you hypocrites!'
  </p>
  <p>'Observe what they do, but do not do as they do, for they do not
   do as they say. They put a load on people's backs, but would not lift
   a single finger to ease it. Hypocrites, they are!'
  </p>
  <p>In any case, since cookies are being baked in a way that G!D knows
   and I do not know - yes, G!D knows and I do not know - the following
   are some questions that you may or may not find helpful to ask yourself,
   depending on where you are at in your consumption of services from
   so-called peace-makers from the land of Psychiatry:
  </p>
  <p>(oh, and the love of money (or worldly wealth, such as breadth of so-called
   knowledge) is the root of Evil), as written in Scriptures. And G!D knows
   what Evil is, and I do not know. And of course G!D is good; good indeed
   is G!D, the Most Merciful and Compassionate One, whom I am of course not above)
  </p>
  <p>What questions?
   </p>
  <p>If you want to make a recovery plan, in case of a - what do they call it -
   relapse:
   <ul>
    <li>what are the early warning signs?
    </li>
  <li>And what to do in a 'relapse'?
    </li>
    <li>
     And what to do to help in moving on?
    </li>
  </ul>
    </p>
 <p>Sharing an example:
 </p>
 <p>Pink's -
 </p>
 <p><i>Oh, laughing, because song comes to mind- 'Pinky and the Brain /
  Pinky and the Brain' - cartoon maybe - 'One does something / the other
  is insane' ha-ha-ha-ha-ha (and laughing still, delightfully)
  </i>
 </p>
 <p>...
 </p>
 <p>And- Pink's warning signs: <i>(can't stop laughing) :-D</i>
  <ul>
   <li>Withdrawing socially from colleagues <br/>
    <i>(now-adays they call it a 'social detox')</i>
   </li>
   <li>Neglecting studies and/or work<br/>
    <i>(I was dis-oriented, and eventually went to practice meditation;
     How can a car with no petrol carry on? You think a pill that is
     white in colour, and bitter to the taste, gonna help a car
     to move when it runs out of petrol? Obviously, it is ineffective
     and inadequate - some people do not want to point out
     the elephant in the room, proverbially speaking - but,
     to learn from those whom G!D has brought me to, maybe what doesn't
     help for me might help for others.) 
    </i>
   </li>
 </ul>
 <p>And G!D, who has not a partner that is associated with G!D, is the
  Most Merciful and Compassionate One, All-knowing and All-seeing
  and All-hearing, and indeed He is the Most High, and not unmindful
  of your deeds. Glory be to G!D, and peace be upon those
  whom G!D favours.
 </p>
 
 </div>
 <div><p>Abraham said, oh- Abraham, whom G!D said of like this: 'He is my friend!' -
  Abraham said, 'as a form of kindness towards me, it should be known that you
  are- it should be known that I am your brother.'
  </p>
  <p>T'was despite the promise that G!D made to Abraham. 'Your descendants
   will be as the stars in the night sky, and the grains of sand on the beach or
   sea-shore - as numerous as all those!' (wow)
  </p>
  <p>
   So, one would expect that Abraham would be honoured as a patriach or
   an ancestor or a fore-father. So, why or what could be a reason
   that he says, 'Call me your brother, as a form of kindness towards me'
   (raising or cocking eyebrows)
  </p>
  <p>So? Who has a possible suggestion?
   </p>
  <p>Well, one out of the many possibilities, including one that is unknown to me,
   is that- what did Jesus Christ say when he ate and drank with sinners
   and prostitutes and the otherwise destitute?
  </p>
  <p>'From now on, you shall call no one on Earth your father. You have
   only one father, and he is in Heaven.'
  </p>
  <p>The practices of certain people come to mind. 'Call me Father,' or something
   like that.
  </p>
  <p>Well, in any case, back to the starting question: Why would a person
   like Abraham want to be called a brother when he had descendants promised
   to him by the LORD G!D?
  </p>
  <p>Well, isn't it a form of kindness to not be called a title that would
   be taken away from you eventually?
  </p>
  <p>To put it in <strike>closer comparison,</strike>
   alternative order
   so you may perchance see, if you have eyes,
   and you can see - for some have sight, and are blind - let the reader understand -
   <strike>Abraham:</strike>
   Jesus: 'You have only one father.'
   Abraham: 'Call me your brother, as a form of kindness towards me.'
  </p>
  <p>So, guess what knowledge did the LORD G!D put into Abraham, in a time
   when the Christ supposedly didn't get sent to the world?
  </p>
  <p>Did someone say 'fore-shadow'? Or 'fore-tell'?
  </p>
  <p>Isn't it cruel to have a title that will be stripped away from you
   eventually? Isn't it a form of kindness to have that title voluntarily
   given away? To be kind to one-self, to give away a thing that
   doesn't last, voluntarily, and cheerfully, and happily - isn't that
   a great kindness for oneself and for others?
  </p>
  <p>If you're interested, you could ask around about renunciation,
   or (relatedly) a way of living that is not about worldly gain, but about liberation
   of others and one-self from needless agony? If not for others, than
   for one-self. Why would I want something that doesn't last? Quite
   obviously, this... hm. Well, G!D knows what to do with web-site-
   the LORD G!D knows best what to do with you and me and afore-mentioned
   and web-site and the universe and the sun and the moon (awe-spiring... not 
   conspiring. Awe-spiring... awe-inspiringly great and marvellous and
   splendidly wondrous are Your deeds, oh Almighty King of kings, Lord
   of lords, who is Compassionate and Most Merciful, and just and true
   in Your judgment and ways, You who are oft-forgiving, and is
   swift and terrible and severe in punishment, for you love
   justice and detest wickedness, and loves not those who
   delight in wickedness.)
  </p>
 </div>
 <div><p>
  To the Compassionate and Most, Most Merciful One,
 the Cherisher and Sustainer of the worlds. Who?
 The All-knowing, All-hearing and All-knowing one,
 who has no beings attached, even though - or, as
 much as - many attach or give partners to the LORD G!D
 Most High, in a way that misleads many people
  </p>
  <p>Now I give an account of a person who said to me, '
   Do you know you have schizophrenia?'
  </p>
  <p>And I gladly boast about this label that those
   who are of the world have given to me, for the sake of
   the Son of Man, Christ Jesus, whom we call Teacher
   and Lord, and whom I am not above.
  </p>
  <p>For is it not written in the Scriptures, that have the
   breath of G!D in every word, the following, or something like it?
   "How blessed are you who are labelled as something evil or
   abnormal or even immoral because of Me, when you come in My name,"
   the Son of Man said. "For that was how their ancestors - fathers -
   treated those whom G!D sent to them: prophets, or prophetesses, oracles:
   messengers who are not above the one who sends the message, truly, truly.
   Jump with gladness; leap for joy; punch your hands into the air
   with a heart that thrills
   and swells with happiness; jump on couches, if you want, to borrow 
   a highly visible person's
   actions that you may or may not be familiar with; for great is your
   reward in Heaven. Yes, celebrate and rejoice on the day or hour
   that that happens." :-)
  </p>
  <p>So glad.
  </p>
  <p>Exceedingly glad, joyful, hm-hm-hm-hm :-) (smirking maybe)
  </p>
  <p>Now, <strike>brothers and sisters</strike>, members of the same family:
   breath of G!D is in every word of Scripture, is it not?
  </p>
  <p>Now in which part of Scripture does it say that there were only
   twelve apostles or disciples or students of the Christ? Is it written
   in Scripture that there is a limit on the number of students who study
   what our Father, the LORD G!D, has sent to us: the sound 
   instruction of our patient, wise and understanding Lord and Teacher?
  </p>
  <p>It has come to my attention that people are saying the following about
   our Teacher and Lord -
  </p>
  
  <p>Those who have hearing: those who have ears, let them hear -
  </p>
  <p>He is possessed by the demon!
  </p>
  <p>In this society you call 'modern', I have heard mockery and ridicule
   that is pressed against the Christ, whom I am not above. And this is
   what Scripture says:
  </p>
  <p>'The Son of Man strictly warned his disciples not to tell anybody about
   what the Father has revealed to them. He said, "The Son of Man 
   must be mocked, ridiculed, spat upon, flogged, despised, rejected by men,
   put to death, and then he will rise from the dead. The Son of Man
   must go through much suffering."
  </p>
  <p>And this is what Scriptures say: "This calls for patient endurance.
   This calls for wisdom."
  </p>
  <p>Brethren, I write to you from Singapore, in the year that you call -
   if you were to borrow what those who are of the world call a calendar -
   2016 - the year after 2016 - 2017.
  </p>
  <p>Stay near to the Lord, oh brethren of mine. Keep up regular praying,
   and take heed to pray to the Father that you and your mouth
   will be opened to what the Father is giving you.
  </p>
  <p>For the signs that the LORD G!D hath shown me include the following
   words which may or may not be glad tidings to you:
  </p>
  <p>"There will be many who will claim to be the CHrist. Do not believe them.
   For each one, ask a confession of them that the Son of Man
   came in the flesh, and rose from the dead. If they confess such a testimony,
   then they are of the Christ, whom G!D will reveal according to His ways,
   which is above my ways. If they say otherwise, then they are of the
   opposing force(s) to the Christ, which you have heard about - say,
   in what some call the book of Revelations - and which are truly
   in the world. For there will be many false prophets."
  </p>
  <p>A story has reached my awareness about a man who has followers
   in the Philippines, for they have revered him as the Christ.
  </p>
  <p>Now, let yourself not be led into temptation, for does not our Teacher
   himself warn the following: "How sorrowful it is (for you)
   when you are welcomed
   and given kingly treatment because of Me, when you come in My name.
   For that was how their fathers - their ancestors - treated the false prophets:
   people who say "as surely as the LORD lives" but surely they declare falsely.
  </p>
  <p>And I say this to you, who can hear: persevere and treat each other as how
   our exceedingly loving and tender-hearted Teacher and Lord has loved us.
  </p>
  <p>For I write from among people who have unbelief in the works of G!D. They
   put their trust in money and what they call "the system". Oh, the poor, deluded
   fool feeds on ashes! Yet they cannot bring themselves to reflect (or think
   to themselves): "Is this thing that I am holding in my hand a lie?"
   </p>
  <p>For I count myself a recipient of rebuke from the LORD G!D, who admonishes
   me as a father disciplines his son out of dear love; I have set pearls
   before swine, so to speak (that is to say, in a manner of speaking), swine
   that trample on them, and then turn to attack me. This happened when the LORD
   G!D has sent me warnings or guidance that goes something like this:
  </p>
  <p>"Do not set your pearls before swine, lest they trample on it, and then turn
   to attack you."
  </p>
  <p>G!D has sent me to a place where the computer that using is surrounded with
   swine.
  </p>
  <p>And I gladly boast about this rebuke from the Ruler of the Universe, as much
   as this makes me a fool. This is to build you up, for we of the Spirit of G!D
   work along-side each other, or, more precisely speaking, walk in each
   other's shoes, along the same path.
  </p>
  <p>Furthermore, I tell you this: What our Teacher said is true:
  </p>
  <p>"Truly, truly, I tell you, you will say or quote this to my face, or to Me
   otherwise: 'Physician, heal yourself!' No prophet is ever honoured in 
   his hometown. Elijah was sent to a widow else-where when there was
   a famine in his hometown, as written in Scriptures."
  </p>
  <p>So, I may or may not be the only one, who has the Spirit of G!D, left.
   Who else has the Spirit of G!D? G!D knows, and I do not know.
  </p>
  <p>Yet I tell you this, brethren. The LORD G!D has promised the following, which
   are recorded in your society: "Will I bring a child to a womb, and then not deliver
   it?"
  </p>
  <p>FOr it does not matter whether the world passes away or not; I seek everlasting
   life through the Father, Son and the Spirit of G!D, who has no beings attached,
   and who has no begotten son.
  </p>
  <p>He who has ears (or she, or they), let them hear.
  </p>
  <p>Am I in trouble? Am I in distress? Are you in trouble? Are you in distress?
   Call to the LORD G!D - the Almighty Creator of all, who is Sovereign over
   the Last Day - seek Him with all your heart, and if G!D is willing, you will
   find G!D.
  </p>
  <p>So, an account of my life may be in order. I grew up in the area of Singapore
   that is known as Clementi. I attended Jin Tai Primary School from the ages
   of seven to twelve. Nan Hua High School (formerly known as Nan Hua
   Secondary School), from the ages of thirteen to sixteen. National Junior
   College, from the ages of seventeen to eighteen. From the ages
   of nineteen to twenty-one, I was drafted into the Singapore Armed Forces,
   as was made compulsory to a male that holds a Singapore citizenship.
   'Conscription,' they call it. from the ages of twenty-one to the time
   of writing, I attended courses, or otherwise enrolled into, National University
   of Singapore.
  </p>
  <p>For four months I went to a foreign land that was known as Taiwan, for the
   ostensible purpose of an exchange semester at National Taiwan University, which
   at that time was located in the city of Taipei.
  </p>
  <p>Upon my return to Singapore, I was met with suspicions that I was possessed
   by the devil, spiritually abused, and in a rather blatant outrage of human dignity,
   surrounded by men when I was alone, and weak of body, and disoriented,
   and sent into (what is known as) Institute of Mental Health
   (formerly known as Woodbridge), where I was mercilessly kept
   in a ward that I could not leave. This happened after I confessed that I followed
   the teachings or sound instruction of our Teacher and Lord, Christ Jesus.
  </p>
  <p>How-ever, G!D has seen it that in His compassionate and 
   Most Merciful and mighty ways, which are above my ways,
   the same diagnosis of schizophrenia that gave people the chance to think they
   can ill-treat me or otherwise rob me of my free movement, physically speaking,
   at least, was a ticket to dis-charge from the Singapore Armed Forces.
  </p>
  <p>I will not tell you what miltary people have told me; suffice to say G!D
   has relieved me of a heavy yoke. And I say this boldly because I put my trust
   in the LORD G!D, and not in men, or women, or captains, or sergeants, or
   presidents, or misters, or missus, or colonels (what-have-you), or brigadier-generals.
   Whoever is harbouring an intent to persecute me, give me what you have.
   For the LORD G!D is the best at planning. Who among you can tell what will
   happen tomorrow? Would you argue a case with the All-knowing, All-hearing
   and All-seeing One who created the heavens and all the earths, and you
   and your very selves? Yes, devise a careful plan, gather your
   psychiatrists and psychologists and your advisers and what-have-you - 
   personal assistants that help you draft your public speeches maybe - 
   and give me what you have. The best you have, come at me. I have made
   my mailing address public, together with my e-mail address. For I fear G!D
   greatly, and with the wisdom that comes from fearing G!D, make the following observations:
  </p>
  <p><ul>
  <li>I know nothing other than what G!D lets me know. This is a fulfillment of what
   our Lord has said: "Every tree that my Father in Heaven did not plant will be torn
   out from the roots." For this reason, even though computer science concepts were
   'taught' to me, for that was my subject matter (or area of study) at university, I have abandoned
   interest in all of those, for the sake of answering the upward call of G!D
   through Christ Jesus.
  </li>
  <li>I happily leave this matter in the capable and loving hands of the blessed Father in Heaven,
   whose name is hallowed. Draconian 'laws'? Abuse of human rights? G!D will do to
   me and to you what G!D sees fit to do. A promise that the LORD G!D made comes to mind,
   a promise that the LORD fulfils from long ago: 'All those who devour you
   shall be devoured". Further, "Those who scoff at you will be scoffed at."
  </li>
  <li>Victory is ours, brethren, overwhelmingly so. Never let yourself think otherwise.
   For the losers are those who reject faith, or deny truth. And on the
   matters that you dispute on, the LORD G!D will reveal the truth to you
   on the Last Day, or in His ways and will, which are higher than mine.
  </li>
  </ul>
  
  </p>
 <p>I happily write, o siblings. Excited and filled with gladness, I am. Encourage
  one another, please, or do the work that G!D has put in you to do. And this absolutely
  counts as a warning to those who are lazy.
 </p>
 <p>Now to the blessed Father be glory - to G!D be the glory for-ever and ever. Amen.
 </p>
 <p>I pray for more workers to be sent, O kin in the same family as I. For the harvest
  is plenty, but the workers are few. So pray for more workers to be sent. The Teacher's words,
  not mine. And yet does the Teacher himself not say that the student, who is not
  above the teacher, but who is training fully, will be like the teacher? Through the name
  of the Christ, whom G!D will reveal to whom-ever G!D chooses to reveal - I make this prayer,
  Father who is blessed indeed.
 </p>
 <p>:-)
 </p>
 <p>May the grace and peace and joy of being in fellowship with our Lord and Teacher,
  Christ Jesus, and the love of G!D, and the fellowship of those who are of the 
  Spirit of G!D - who has no beings attached, as a reminder - be with you. 
 </p>
 <p>I am afraid that divisions among you will cause unnecessary trouble.
  Buddhists, Christians, Jews, Gentiles (or outsiders), or people who identify
  with 'New Age',
  or Muslims, those who study the Tao Te Ching, or Zhuangzi (or Zhuang-zhou) - 
  the list goes on - is it not written in the Scriptures or what some
  call the Bible the following?
 </p>
 <p>There is no division. There is no Jew or Gentile, no male or female,
  no artist or programmer - all are one through Christ Jesus.
 </p>
 <p>G!D will reveal it to those whom G!D chooses to reveal it to, regarding
  what I am saying. I leave it to G!D to decide on this matter. Those
  who can hear, let them hear.
 </p>
 <p>To G!D, the Most Merciful and Compassionate One be glory for-ever and ever.
  Why, is not the first and greatest and fore-most commandment to love G!D
  with all of what-e'er? All of me, all of you? O, they love idols as much
  as they should love G!D; and they have led many astray. And G!D has no beings
  attached, to remind you again.
 </p>
 <p>So the saying is true, as written in Scriptures: 'The dog returns to its vomit'.
  And swine, after washing in water, roll in the mud. As surely
  as the LORD - the Holy One of Israel - lives, I have witnessed this.
 </p>
 <p>If it helps you, brethren, the Quran is said to confirm the gospel
  and revelations. And it is as a purifier for your mind.
 </p>
 <p>And let not their blatant incense-burning and kow-tows in front of carven
  images deceive you into thinking that what they do is right in the eyes
  of G!D, who says "Thou shalt not take for worship any before the LORD G!D,
  who has no beings attached."
 </p>
 <p>G!D will do to stubborn idol-worshippers what G!D will do. And indeed human
  effort is nothing, so happily I finish this writing with praise to G!D for
  His lovingkindness: wonders, signs and terrors: remembering. Thank You for
  milk, Papa (Father). G!D is good!

  <p>It will be as in the days of the generation
   of Noah. People marrying and giving in marriage,
   eating an' drinking, were, knowing nothing
   about flood that came upon them until it came,
   and Noah and those whom G!D had commanded Noah
   to take with him - Oh, Noah obeyed what
   G!D told him. That is to say, he did not
   say 'No' to G!D out of defiance (or wilfulness);
   neither 
   did he refuse to believe in the one whom
   G!D has sent (You know the god I am talking
   about: He who created the Universe and every-thing
   in it, the All-knowing, All-hearing and All-seeing
   Sovereign over the Day of Judgment who loves
   justice and detests wickedness) - and when
   destruction was complete, Noah asked G!D
   for permission to dis-embark from where
   G!D had spared him from destruction. (maybe
   in the Quran, this is written)
  </p>
  <p>O prophet, your words will only be heeded-
   your advice will only be heeded by those
   who fear G!D, and are repentant, or otherwise
   willing to reconcile themselves to Him. (as written
   in the Quran). (the reader might want to compare
   this to the parable of the sower and the seed
   that Christ Jesus, son of Mary, gave, and which
   is recorded in Scriptures that are known as 
   the Bible).
  </p>
  <p>Quit? Oh LORD, let not Your spirit away from me!
  </p>
  <p>On a point which may be elusive to people
   in some parts of- any-way, elusive to some people-
   is what exactly does it mean to say 'Thou
   art my shepherd; I shall not want.'
   
  </p>
  <p>G!D has given me the grace to type
   on a night in the tropics, so write I will,
   gladly. G!D brought me to
   <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/441024.Great_Fool?ac=1&from_search=true">
   a book
      </a>
   that is on- <br/><i>
   (checking it up in an information store, the Internet
   address of which is as follows)</i><br/>

   <br/>
   a person who calls himself 'Great Fool'.
  </p>
  <p>In any case, a passage or idea from that book
   is that on the way to enlightenment,
   alms-taking is required. To put it in 
   a way that is a little more familiar
   to the lay-man, or more precisely, those
   people who reside in urban areas (that is,
   not exactly pastoral), begging is required.
   A better-sounding name, that book has given
   that. Going to check information store again.
  </p>
  <p>'mendiciary'. 
  </p>
  <p>Or more precisely, 'mendicancy'.
  </p>
  <p>Perchance the starting point may have
   been forgotten. What does it mean to say,
   'Thou art my shepherd. I shall not want'?
  </p>
  <p>How can one trust in a higher power that
   feeds and clothes one unconditionally, unless
   power is given over to the higher power in question
   to feed and clothe one?
  </p>
  <p>What coming to mind is: Jesus. The disciples
   began arguing among themselves about who
   among them was the greatest in the kingdom
   of Heaven. Taking a little one to Jesus,
   Jesus said, 'Truly, truly, I tell you,
   those who humble yourself as this little one
   is the greatest in the kingdom of Heaven.'
   (among numerous other examples, of little
   ones being a model to Man, that Jesus gave).
  </p>
  <p>You ever saw a little one - say, one year
   of age, in your so-called modern measures
   of time - suit up in tie and tuxedo, and
   wait tables? Or pump petrol for others
   at a gas station? Who feeds a one-year-old?
  </p>
  <p>You wanna be greatest in kingdom of Heaven?
   How about you learn from a one-year-old about
   trust in a world that feeds you, and clothes
   you unconditionally, among other things
   that a one-year-old can teach you, if you choose
   to humble yourself? 
  </p>
  <p>To emphasise on what Jesus - who is Teacher
   and Lord, as it should be - said, verse from Bible:
   And he said to them:
   "Truly I tell you, unless you change and 
   become like little children, you will never 
   enter the kingdom of Heaven." 
   <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/18-3.htm">
   (Gospel of Matthew, chapter eighteen, verse three.
    http://biblehub.com/matthew/18-3.htm)
   </a>
  </p>
  <p>So, back to the beginning. What does it mean
   to you to say the following:
   'Thou art my shepherd; I shall not want"
  </p>
  <p>On a some-what related note, G!D
   has given me a chance to attend a lesson
   or example of what some call homoletics.
   'Big' word? Or complicated word?
   How about this: how to communicate
   more effectively?
  </p>
  <p>So one of the ideas during that demonstration
   or lesson that came up in mind was the 
   art of repetition, which interestingly
   enough, is a rather prominent feature
   in classical music, or music from the
   period of your development that some
   have called 'the Classical period'.
  </p>
  <p>Maybe those who are familar with a certain
   type of computers know it as 'copy-and-paste'.
   So, the art of repetition (a concept that
   G!D has introduced me to in a music course,
   which is, of course, from the-LORD-who-will-provide)-
   the art of repetition is how you 'copy-and-paste',
   not just what you 'copy-and-paste'. 
  </p>
  <p>So, parable of sower and seeds, coming to mind
   again.
  </p>
  <p>Hm. To sum up, 
   <ul><li>
    humble yourself as a little one.
    If you do not, no kingdom of Heav'n.</li>
  
  <li>you say 'Thou art my shepherd.
   I shall not want'. What does that mean to you?
   Are you even giving yourself a chance
   to be shepherd-ed - clothed and fed unconditionally?
  </li>
  </ul>
  </p>
 <p>So, having examples- but, demonstration
  of homoletics included a clear warning to not
  introduce to you - or the audience, or the
  people you are preaching to - any new content
  or points, (where) in the conclusion, or where
  you have told your audience where you will end.
 </p>
 <p>My time is short, how-ever. G!D will take
  my life - or what people of the world think
  of as life, to be more accurately speaking -
  according to His will, which is above my will.
 </p>
 <p>Sufficient for you, it is becoming clear,
  that there are highly visible persons among
  your urban (that isn't exactly pastoral) 
  societies who have attempted- not suicide-
  mendiciary. (begging. taking alms.)
 </p>
 <p>So, to repeat, if you don't give a higher power
  - or, a higher being who causes rain or water to fall from
  the sky so that your thirst may be satisfied -
  (oh, thank You for the rain, oh, Papa (Father)
  who is Ruler of the Universe, whose name
  is hallowed. Why, G!D, Your people have
  created imitations of the sound of rain-drops
  falling on surfaces, so that they may be
  soothed or otherwise comforted, or find
  a common humanity)-
  to repeat, if you do not give a higher power
  a chance to feed you un-conditionally, what is it
  to you to spend time with words that have
  the breath of G!D in them? What is it to you to
  say or see the following: 'Thou art my shepherd;
  I shall not want.'
 </p>
 </div>
 
 <div><p>
  
  to have the no small honour to obey the guidance
  that <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-14.htm"> 
  the mighty helper of worm Jacob and little Israel
  </a>
  has given me (even me), offering
  <a href="https://tinyletter.com/now-to-Jehovah-be-the-glory-for-ever-and-ever-amen">
   a service</a> 
  that is
  in obedience to the following verse: <br/>
  <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/81-3.htm">
  Blow the ram's horn at new moon, and again
   at full moon to call a festival! (Psalm 81:3)
  </a>
  </p>
  
  <p>
   G!D knows, and I do not know what will happen. :-)
  </p>
  <p>
   Nevertheless, a verse from Scripture, every word
   of which has the breath of G!D in them, seems fitting:
   <br/> <a 
            href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Peter+5&version=KJV">
    Be alert and of sober mind.
    Your enemy, the devil, prowls around 
    like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour
    (1 Peter 5:8)
   </a>
  </p>
  </p>
 </div>
 <div><p>
  May the love of G!D - 
  <a href="http://www.comp.leeds.ac.uk/nora/html/2-135.html">
  who instructs me to say
  to those who ask if I want to convert to their
  religion 
  (or otherwise turn to, or enter into their practices) 
  the following: 'Nay, I would rather the religion
  of the True Abraham, and worship the Almighty One,
  who created the sky above and the earth below and
  everything in the Universe, and who judges
  over the Last Day
  </a>

  It is the 106th year since G!D helped
  a foolish fool who spoke up for worthless
  idols - carven images that cannot save
  his soul, nor help him restore his saltiness,
  if he were salt that had lost his saltiness -
  and it is the twelth month since G!D
  chased the mischief-makers - those who
  delight in wickedness, and say, 'We
  are peace-makers', when it is they
  who are surely the mischief-makers
  or those who delight in mischief or
  wickedness - away from before a subject
  of mockery, and ridicule, and torture,
  and torment, and severe programming,
  of mind, that damages psyche. (not the
  mythological Psyche, daughter of
  Eros and G!D-knows-who-and-I-do-not-know).

  </a></p>
  <p>
   Who are the people you admire and what values or traits do they have that you want to take on?
你欣赏的人是谁？他们有什么你想要采取的原则或特征？
<ul>
 <li>
Mike Cernovich for saying he wants to inspire people,
  being an online badass, being bold, and producing content 
  that intrigues people, to me, at least. Striving 
  for what he's worth. Also, giving people strength 
  and giving females strength. He taught confidence with guns[,]
  to his fiance.
 </li>
 <li>
 Afrojack for giving people hope because to me his songs create a positive mentality
 </li>
 <li>
 Paul van Dyk for giving people happiness because to me his songs or sounds have a very strong connection with people's emotions
 </li>
 <li>
 Steve Aoki for letting females guest-appear because it's manly.
 </li>
  </ul>
  
  </p>
 <p>So, it's your turn. What about you? 
  Who do you admire, and what are traits
  in them that you want to nurture
  in yourself? If you're interested,
  a related concept is self-differentiation.
  And the context is - well, huh, a 
  somewhat obscure, or maybe not, topic - 
  of 'ego enmeshment' (you can check it up
  on the Internet, or [with]
  a family therapist,
  maybe) - or on a brazenly spiritual
  note, renunciation, or liberation
  from suffering, which may or may not
  involve doing some voluntary (and
  definitely painful) separation of
  self from others. A 
  <strike>popular</strike>
  song-singer (Or song-writer)
  goes: 'I've just
  gotta
  find who I am /
  and who I'm not /
  I won't give up on us /
  who I am /
  what I am /
  who I'm not /
  what I'm not /
  I won't give up on us'
  or something like that.
 </p>
 <p>What? Ya, uh, so
  took some time, thought
  I've lost myself,
  but seems kinda,
  that was ne'er me in the first place /
  never was me /
  what I thought was me /
  was never me /
  So, bombastic, big words /
  family therapy /
  for me /
  may just help me /
  put words that seem /
  small but can be big /
  and mighty with the /
  help of G!D /
  All I'm sayin' is /
  If you're thinkin' you're crazy /
  you're probably going somewhere /
  hey, I'm happy /
  And it feels great to shout it out /
  even though G!D may be the only one /
  who hears me / I'm still happy /
  G!D, I love You, O LORD,
  King of the Universe /
  Hey, hey, hey, hey /
  praise and glory and kingdom /
  and power are yours, O / 
  blessed Father who is in /
  Heaven /

  What? What are you looking at?
  Can't you see tis about you?
  (Can't you see that it is about you?)
  Supposedly one of the quotes that G!D has
  brought me before,
  from a Mister Homeless Kodo. Mister
  Suzuki. (
  
  whom G!D has also
  shown me to have human foibles,
  especially in it: (what)
  faith in
  the one whom G!D has sent,
  and trust in a higher Mind.
  But who am I to comment?
  'For we are indeed not perfect.
  If we were perfect, we would be a perfect
  man, able to control every part
  of our body, or every organ - for example,
  anus (or
  burps or farts
  or thoughts or itches) - at will. So, not many of you,
  brethren, should become teachers,
  for we are indeed judged more
  strictly, or stringently, than
  others.' (from Scriptures). 
  </p>
  <p>
   So, something G!D gave me, now giving
   as freely as it was received.
   So in certain village,
   people live and glory themselves
   in their shameful nakedness. And
   they do not know it, so they are disgraced.
   (like the well-known story of
   the emperor with no clothes, but another
   story that is, for another time.)
   (and indeed I am nothing at all.)
   So, G!D has mercifully and compassionately
   brought me before a set of questions
   to hold hands, if you will, of those
   who chase money or riches of the world. 
   They are as follows:
   <ul>
   <li><strike>First</strike>'C': what is the centre
    of my life? ('You must have an 
    un-shake-able centre,' said the
    one whom G!D had brought me to.)</li>
    <li><strike>Second</strike> 'C': 
    What is the character of my life?
     (memory is a little foggy. shomething
     about shape. Mnemonics (that is, memory
     device. To make memorisation 
     easier.) S-H-A-P-E.
     <ul><li>
      'S". Support maybe?</li>
      <li>
     'H'. Happiness? What makes me happy?
     Or what makes me feel good?
     Good feels that come without
     drugs that cost money?
     (A certain Mister Robbins
     talked about this in a book.
     'Making love with my wife, that
     makes me feel good,' he said. '
     Exercise on [some equipment
     
     something something].') 
    </li>
     <li>
     'A'.
     
     Attractive? Which part of me
     or my life do I find really
     attractive? G!D
     brought me to an exercise
     that a person required
     for homework during
     university years. 'Ask
     your friends, or people
     whom
     you've worked with,
     for your
     RBS. (what's RBS) [Something]
     Best Self. Ask them
     when they saw you at your best.
     Co-workers. People you've 
     lost touch with.
     People whom you maybe
     did some research with,
     or did a project with. (and
     then separated or dis-banded
     after that.)
     In my case,
     that was homework, and it felt
     awkward to ask. But am I glad I 
     did that. (in
     hind-sight). Others viewed me
     in a positive light, because
     the question was about
     my best possible self. And that was
     pleasantly surprising. It helped me
     feel esteemed in away I did not know
     I could feel esteemed. It's kinda healthy,
     not bragging pridefully, more accepting,
     if you will, what you've got in this
     brief life? (['cos] Baby you're a fire-work /
     Come on, let your colours burst / 
     Let them go high, hi, high / 
     (make them go: 'ah, ah, ah')
     As you shoot across the sky - aye,
     aye' (G!D brought me to a little
     one who sang something like that.)
     So that's 's', 'h', and 'a'.
     'p' and 'e' are left. Wow. 
     What an exercise for memory.</li>
     <li>
     'P'. Personality maybe? Or 
     your points of pain? You know,
     loneliness could be a point of pain.
     And, uh,
     If you talk about it, you don't
     have to, but if you wanna, maybe,
     just maybe, you'll find some
     solace. You could put in a diary
     maybe. Or you could really-
     it's gonna sound icky or 
     off-putting, at first, at least,
     but you could try... talking to a
     counsellor. A professional one.
     I talked to a counsellor myself.
     And it helped that it was non-judgmental.
     (G!D gave me a quote in my life: 
     'People are so in lack - or
     maybe not in lack, but simply
     forgotten - on the skill of
     listening. That's why
     you have people <strike>now</strike> who are
     getting paid to listen. Life
     coaches. Counsellors. Whatever
     you call them. So,
     stigma aside, you definitely
     deserve - it won't be apparent,
     at first - you have every right
     to be attended to, or listened
     to, without any judgment coming
     into what you are trying to say.
     So, those people you hang out
     with over a beer might not be
     the best at helping to talk
     about whatever you wanna talk
     about. Yeah. You do not
     realise it know, but you definitely
     deserve attention or care that does not
     feel like [eating]
     a rotten sandwich. Or,
     you deserve to be away from
     people, whoops, any-body
     or any voice in your head that
     tells you you deserve only
     to eat a rotten sandwich. But of 
     course, you won't realise it now;
     but you will realise or understand
     after-ward.
     So, that's 'P'.</li>
     <li>
      And 'E'. (laughing). (huh).
     You know, it is written in Scriptures,
     'Sarah said, "G!D has made me
     laugh - G!D made me laugh - so
     that those who can hear will laugh
     with me."'  
     So, 'E' is for 'experience[s]'.
    </li>
     </ul>
     So that's 'SHAPE'. S-H-A-P-E.
     So, what came to mind, was 
     how those who are labelled
     with mental illnesses may not
     be experts in knowledge (or
     so-called knowledge) of so-called
     mental illnesses. As much as that
     may be so, they are experts on 
     their experiences. Experts by experience,
     they are. Just like how you
     can get a Master's degree by research
     or thesis or what- uh, what-ever.)
     So, ask yourself: where are the subjective experts on
     their experiences? Are you an expert on
     your experience of life or G!D or god? 
     So, what are they, those whom you call
     'patients' or 'un-well', if you
     are an expert on your experience 
     of life or your limits or your
     god? Are they any less or any more
     an expert on your experience of life,
     than you are an expert on theirs? So,
     how come you are the expert
     [on their life], and not them?
     'You hypocrite. You say to your brother,
     "take the pin out of your eye. Here, let me
     help you." Take the log out of your
     own eye first, then you can see clearly
     to help your brother.' That's what Jesus said.
     It's in Scriptures. And hate me. Why?
     Because Jesus was hated, too. And I'm
     honoured to be in his company. Or the
     company of those whom G!D sends, for
     they are ridiculed by those of the world,
     since the times of the fathers of those
     who ridicule the messengers of G!D. This is in
     Scriptures. Send me everything you got,
     in your hatred or hate, because G!D is
     the best at planning. And if you wait,
     I, too, will wait. And my fear is
     fear of G!D. Not fear of
     seeming foolish or incompetent, although
     that got to me, too, while chasing
     after yardsticks, what-ever - which I realise,
     that as long as G!D loves me, I need no
     benchmark or yardstick to measure myself
     against, other than my obedience to G!D.
     And how do you measure that? So, any-way.
     
     
  
  <li>
   Back to the 'C', huh. 'Centre of my life'.
   'Character of my life'. Then, another 'C'.
   'Community'. Who are my people?

  'For we brought nothing into the world, andb neither can we carry anything out of it. 8But if we have food and clothing, we will be content with these.

9Those who want to be rich, however, fall into temptation and become ensnared by many foolish and harmful desires that plunge them into ruin and destruction. 10For the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil. By craving it, some have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many sorrows.

Fight the Good Fight

  With G!D's help, reading the information

  empowered. If G!D is willing, you may

  do not beat yourself up too much; you do
  not have to do that, even though there
  is a tendency to; or, there can be a tendency to.
  G!D knows, and I do not know, what you are going through.
  G!D knows best what to do with you. I'm just
  glad, if you have been labelled with 'schizophrenia',
  (or other psychiatric labels or labels of other kinds)
  that you have come or visited web-site. The LORD be with

    that what society ultimately benefits
    from requires even rejection from that very same
    society, and definitely a separation from
    society. (and that's putting it mildly.)
    Jesus says it better, or Scriptures: '

  Your Almighty G!D and my Almighty G!D are the same G!D. He created Heaven and Earth and the Universe and everything in it. He is G!D of Abraham, and G!D of the prophets. <br/>
  
  Compassionate and Merciful in the Most - G!D who is slow to anger, and oft-forgiving, Whom thou shalt not put to the test (as Scripture says). <br/>
  
  In my folly I have prostituted myself to something that cannot help me at all. Detestably, I have taken a toilet-bowl (or a water-closet) - you know, a pipe that you poop in -
  as a god. I have feared the wrath of a god of a toilet bowl, and attempted to please that god. Over a period of time, those attempts included: knelt in front of a toilet-bowl; bit a toilet-bowl. <br/>
  
  'Save me,' I desperately cried to a toilet-bowl. <br/>
  
  'The poor, deluded fool feeds on ashes. He trusts in something that cannot help him at all! Yet he cannot bring himself to reflect or think to himself: "Is this thing, that I am holding in my hand, a lie?" (Isaiah 44:20) <br/>
  
  And yet, G!D has enabled me to write this, and I thank the Almighty Lord of lords, and King of kings; praise G!D, I do, for He has shown loving-kindness, and mercy that is in the Most High.
  
  To G!D be the glory. <br/>
  
  It took time. And terrors, admonishments (out of dear love), and signs and wonders, G!D has convinced me that He has paid a price to redeem a prostitute like myself. <br/>
  
  'This observance will be for you like a sign on your hand and a reminder on your forehead that this law of the LORD is to be on your lips. For the LORD brought you out of Egypt with his mighty hand.'

  (Exodus 13:9, New International Version)
  </a>
  
  <br/>
  
  'You will tell your son: 'I do this, because the LORD, G!D of Abraham and the Prophets, has done wonders and marvels for me when He brought me out of Egypt.' (Exodus 13:8)
  
  <br/>
  
  So, testify, as a witness of G!D, I shall.
  
  Drugs - things: bitter in taste, white in colour, and smaller than a finger-nail in size. Those whom I turned to - shepherds, of renown in the land -
  charged me money for those things, and kept me in a pen that I could not leave from, even if I asked nicely. <br />
  
  'This thing gives me uneasiness. I wake up in the middle of the night to walk; I feel compelled. And it gives me convulsions in my hands sometimes.' 
  
  This I told them. <br/>
  
  And they said, 'Here's another thing. Eat it. It controls the uneasiness of the thing that you talked about.' <br/>
  
  'But,' they continued, 'It does things to you, even though it controls the thing that you talked about.' <br />
  
  I did not know what they talked about. This thing, that thing. <br />
  
  The shepherds - some of them, at least - intimidated me. 'If you do not do as we say,' they hinted, in a way that was not very nice, 'you will keep staying in this pen. You will not be let out.'
 <br /> 
  So, ate both things, I tremulously did. Indeed, I was afraid of consequences that men promised unto me, instead of fearing the Almighty One.
  
  I wanted to get out of that pen. And so, I dis-obeyed not, but co-operated, although I have voiced my defiance to their ways a few times. <br />
  <br />
  'Finish your food,' they said. And I was afraid. So I ate, although I had been feeling very full at that point.
  <br />
  (Later they would give me a recipe for 'sayur lodeh', when I asked them how to make a certain mixture that I had eaten.)

  'Drink water with your "medicine",' they said. And I was fed up. 'No,' I said. 'I am going to eat "medicine" without water. See, it enters my body just fine.' <br />
  
  And they said, in a way that was not very nice, 'Drink water with the "medicine", or else.' <br />
  
  I walked away, but I was anxious to get out of that pen, and keen to appear co-operative. (And they had others to talk to.) So, I returned to them, but they said, 'Don't worry. We've recorded that you were obedient enough. That is, that you have eaten "medicine".'
  <br />
  Anyhow, this story is becoming godless.
  <br />
  Long story short, they left me. they care nothing for me. <br />
  
  All your lovers have forgotten you;
they care nothing for you;
for I have dealt you the blow of an enemy,
the punishment of a merciless foe,
because your guilt is great,
because your sins are flagrant. (Jeremiah 30:14, ESV)
  
  <br/>
  Alas! That day is so great
there is none like it;
it is a time of distress for Jacob;
yet he shall be saved out of it. (Jeremiah 30:7)
  
  <br/>
  
  'For I will restore health to you,
and your wounds I will heal,'

declares the Lord,
'because they have called you an outcast:
"It is Zion, for whom no one cares!" (Jeremiah 30:17)

  <br />
  Therefore all who devour you shall be devoured,
and all your foes, every one of them, shall go into captivity;
those who plunder you shall be plundered,
and all who prey on you I will make a prey.' (Jeremiah 30:16)
  <br />
  'For I am with you to save you,'

declares the Lord;
'I will make a full end of all the nations
among whom I scattered you,
but of you I will not make a full end.
I will discipline you in just measure,
and I will by no means leave you unpunished.' (Jeremiah 30:11)
  <br />
  'Then fear not, O Jacob my servant, declares the Lord,
nor be dismayed, O Israel;
for behold, I will save you from far away,
and your offspring from the land of their captivity.
Jacob shall return and have quiet and ease,
and none shall make him afraid.' (Jeremiah 30:10)
  
 <br />
  Indeed, as it is written in the Bible, G!D exalts those who humble themselves before Him, and humbles those who exalt themselves before Him.
  <br />
  Why?
  <br /> For it is written in the Bible: '
  Now you are slaves
    of other nations,
but I will break the chains
and smash the yokes
    that keep you in slavery.
Then you will be my servants,
and I will choose a king for you
    from the family of David.'
  (Jeremiah 30:8-9, CEV)
  <br />
  Almighty One, great are your deeds! Fabulous, marvellous!
  <br />
  Why?
  <br />
  For is it not written in the Bible: 'Your hearts will swell with joy - even your heart of hearts - and you will be as calves let out to pasture.'
  <br />
  I praise You, G!D, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Your works are wonderful; that I know full well. (from the Bible)
  <br />
  And it is written in the Quran: 'If good touches you, it distresses them; but if harm strikes you, they rejoice at it. And if you are patient and fear Allah , their plot will not harm you at all. Indeed, Allah is encompassing of what they do.'
  <a href="http://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=3&verse=120">(Chapter 3, verse 120)</a>
  
  <br />
   'Bless those who persecute you. Don’t curse them; pray that God will bless them. Be happy with those who are happy, and weep with those who weep.'
  <a href="http://biblehub.com/nlt/romans/12.htm">
   (Romans 12:14-15, NLT)
  </a>
 <br />
  'Dear friends, never take revenge. Leave that to the righteous anger of God. For the Scriptures say,

“I will take revenge;
I will pay them back,”
says the LORD.
Instead,
“If your enemies are hungry, feed them.
If they are thirsty, give them something to drink.
In doing this, you will heap
burning coals of shame on their heads.”
Don’t let evil conquer you, but conquer evil by doing good.'
  (Romans 12:19-21, NLT)
  <br />
  'Be merciful, as your Master is merciful.' - Jesus
  <br />
  So, G!D admonishes and sets trials and obstacles. Admonishes out of dear love. Trials, so that if you overcome, a reward is for you, with the LORD, G!D of Abraham. (Book of Revelations, if you're interested.)
  <br />
  Happily ever after, by a servant of G!D who created Heaven and Earth - G!D who knows all, hears all and sees all (G!D knows and you do not) - G!D who knows the hearts and minds of men, G!D who loves justice, and detests wickedness.
  <br />
  So remind me, G!D, to fear You, and to humble myself before You, and to let Your will be done, not mine.
  <br />
  'And this same God who takes care of me will supply all your needs from his glorious riches, which have been given to us in Christ Jesus.'
  <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians+4%3A19&version=NLT">
  (Phillipians 4:19, NLT)
  </a>
  <br />
  For it is written in the Quran: 'Bring glad tidings, invite them to your LORD, practice charity openly and secretly, and do righteousness that is godly - it is not righteousness to turn to the
  East or the West, but it is righteousness to obey G!D, and to keep His commandments.'

 In the Quran, it is written: 'Take Sadaqah (alms) from their wealth in order to purify them and sanctify them with it, and invoke Allah for them. Verily! Your invocations are a source of security for them, and Allah is All-Hearer, All-Knower.'

 To you who think you have 'mental illness', and are trying to 'control' that with abominations that are man-made, the Bible has a 
 verse, oh the G!D-breathed Word that is suitable for rebuking and disciplining so that you are wise for salvation through
 the Christ: 'A house divided cannot stand'
</p>

<p>
 
 On people who are involved with the death penalty: executioner, legal procedure people. The Bible has said, 'Put away your swords,
 For those who live by the sword will die by the sword.' <br/> And that is supposedly a gift from the Lord Christ Jesus. 'Those who have
 Ears, let them hear,’goes another part of the Bible.
 </p>



<p>
 Now when Jesus was asked 
 'Are you Son of G!d'
 Jesus said 
 'It is as you say. Furthermore, I tell you now that I am resurrecting in three days after my death,
 by the power given me by my Father in Heaven'
 'Blasphemy,' they said, sending Jesus to crucifixion 
 (Thy will be done on Heaven, and thy will be done on earth as on Heaven. O blessed are you, Father in Heaven, King of the Universe, Ruler of Heaven. Hallowed be thy name.)
 Apostle Paul said,
 'My execution of Christians was before the Lord Christ Jesus appeared to me, saying, 'Why are you killing me?'
 Now, conscience of mine, it is clear before G!d and man.'
 It is written in the Bible, 'Christ- the Christ lives in me.'
 And it written in the Bible. What? Paul was preaching to people who heard him, but they began leaving 
 After hearing him say. What?
 You hear always but do not understand
 </p>


<p>
 Routine that is awkward and painful is no longer music to my ears /
 Often, people don't always take care of themselves /
 Why don't they love themselves /
 Birds came in, red /
 and purple too /
 That's what they turned my skin into /
 Ain't that a sharp pain there /
 Oh, why do they hurt me so /
 My kiss to them /
 Lets my blood out /
 They continue chirping /
 Perhaps this is the time /
 to say it's- /
 o /
 it's not okay /
 why do my tears flow /
 oh, joy /
 ow /
 it's time to die, the birds say /
 death-songs come softly /
 please forgive them, Heavenly Compassionate Father /
 Boom
