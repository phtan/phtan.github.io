  When does tiger not run from sheep?
  When does tiger not run after sheep?
  When does sheep not run from tiger :-) *_*
  ('Wolves - man is the wolf of man', G!D 
  reminds me of a quote from 
  <a href="http://antaiji.org/">somewhere</a>)
  Stone tiger stares at stone sheep.
  No running, no hiding. No flinching.
  Stone sheep does not run from stone
  tiger. ^_^
  <p>'I am sending you as sheep among
   wolves. Lambs. Therefore, be
   as shrewd as snakes, and as
   innocent as doves.' - Jesus,

  What? What are you looking at?
  Can't you see tis about you?
  (Can't you see that it is about you?)
  Supposedly one of the quotes that G!D has
  brought me before,
  from a Mister Homeless Kodo. Mister
  Suzuki. (
  
  whom G!D has also
  shown me to have human foibles,
  especially in it: (what)
  faith in
  the one whom G!D has sent,
  and trust in a higher Mind.
  But who am I to comment?
  'For we are indeed not perfect.
  If we were perfect, we would be a perfect
  man, able to control every part
  of our body, or every organ - for example,
  anus (or
  burps or farts
  or thoughts or itches) - at will. So, not many of you,
  brethren, should become teachers,
  for we are indeed judged more
  strictly, or stringently, than
  others.' (from Scriptures). 
  </p>
  <p>
   So, something G!D gave me, now giving
   as freely as it was received.
   So in certain village,
   people live and glory themselves
   in their shameful nakedness. And
   they do not know it, so they are disgraced.
   (like the well-known story of
   the emperor with no clothes, but another
   story that is, for another time.)
   (and indeed I am nothing at all.)
   So, G!D has mercifully and compassionately
   brought me before a set of questions
   to hold hands, if you will, of those
   who chase money or riches of the world. 
   They are as follows:
   <ul>
   <li><strike>First</strike>'C': what is the centre
    of my life? ('You must have an 
    un-shake-able centre,' said the
    one whom G!D had brought me to.)</li>
    <li><strike>Second</strike> 'C': 
    What is the character of my life?
     (memory is a little foggy. shomething
     about shape. Mnemonics (that is, memory
     device. To make memorisation 
     easier.) S-H-A-P-E.
     <ul><li>
      'S". Support maybe?</li>
      <li>
     'H'. Happiness? What makes me happy?
     Or what makes me feel good?
     Good feels that come without
     drugs that cost money?
     (A certain Mister Robbins
     talked about this in a book.
     'Making love with my wife, that
     makes me feel good,' he said. '
     Exercise on [some equipment
     
     something something].') 
    </li>
     <li>
     'A'.
     
     Attractive? Which part of me
     or my life do I find really
     attractive? G!D
     brought me to an exercise
     that a person required
     for homework during
     university years. 'Ask
     your friends, or people
     whom
     you've worked with,
     for your
     RBS. (what's RBS) [Something]
     Best Self. Ask them
     when they saw you at your best.
     Co-workers. People you've 
     lost touch with.
     People whom you maybe
     did some research with,
     or did a project with. (and
     then separated or dis-banded
     after that.)
     In my case,
     that was homework, and it felt
     awkward to ask. But am I glad I 
     did that. (in
     hind-sight). Others viewed me
     in a positive light, because
     the question was about
     my best possible self. And that was
     pleasantly surprising. It helped me
     feel esteemed in away I did not know
     I could feel esteemed. It's kinda healthy,
     not bragging pridefully, more accepting,
     if you will, what you've got in this
     brief life? (['cos] Baby you're a fire-work /
     Come on, let your colours burst / 
     Let them go high, hi, high / 
     (make them go: 'ah, ah, ah')
     As you shoot across the sky - aye,
     aye' (G!D brought me to a little
     one who sang something like that.)
     So that's 's', 'h', and 'a'.
     'p' and 'e' are left. Wow. 
     What an exercise for memory.</li>
     <li>
     'P'. Personality maybe? Or 
     your points of pain? You know,
     loneliness could be a point of pain.
     And, uh,
     If you talk about it, you don't
     have to, but if you wanna, maybe,
     just maybe, you'll find some
     solace. You could put in a diary
     maybe. Or you could really-
     it's gonna sound icky or 
     off-putting, at first, at least,
     but you could try... talking to a
     counsellor. A professional one.
     I talked to a counsellor myself.
     And it helped that it was non-judgmental.
     (G!D gave me a quote in my life: 
     'People are so in lack - or
     maybe not in lack, but simply
     forgotten - on the skill of
     listening. That's why
     you have people <strike>now</strike> who are
     getting paid to listen. Life
     coaches. Counsellors. Whatever
     you call them. So,
     stigma aside, you definitely
     deserve - it won't be apparent,
     at first - you have every right
     to be attended to, or listened
     to, without any judgment coming
     into what you are trying to say.
     So, those people you hang out
     with over a beer might not be
     the best at helping to talk
     about whatever you wanna talk
     about. Yeah. You do not
     realise it know, but you definitely
     deserve attention or care that does not
     feel like [eating]
     a rotten sandwich. Or,
     you deserve to be away from
     people, whoops, any-body
     or any voice in your head that
     tells you you deserve only
     to eat a rotten sandwich. But of 
     course, you won't realise it now;
     but you will realise or understand
     after-ward.
     So, that's 'P'.</li>
     <li>
      And 'E'. (laughing). (huh).
     You know, it is written in Scriptures,
     'Sarah said, "G!D has made me
     laugh - G!D made me laugh - so
     that those who can hear will laugh
     with me."'  
     So, 'E' is for 'experience[s]'.
    </li>
     </ul>
     So that's 'SHAPE'. S-H-A-P-E.
     So, what came to mind, was 
     how those who are labelled
     with mental illnesses may not
     be experts in knowledge (or
     so-called knowledge) of so-called
     mental illnesses. As much as that
     may be so, they are experts on 
     their experiences. Experts by experience,
     they are. Just like how you
     can get a Master's degree by research
     or thesis or what- uh, what-ever.)
     So, ask yourself: where are the subjective experts on
     their experiences? Are you an expert on
     your experience of life or G!D or god? 
     So, what are they, those whom you call
     'patients' or 'un-well', if you
     are an expert on your experience 
     of life or your limits or your
     god? Are they any less or any more
     an expert on your experience of life,
     than you are an expert on theirs? So,
     how come you are the expert
     [on their life], and not them?
     'You hypocrite. You say to your brother,
     "take the pin out of your eye. Here, let me
     help you." Take the log out of your
     own eye first, then you can see clearly
     to help your brother.' That's what Jesus said.
     It's in Scriptures. And hate me. Why?
     Because Jesus was hated, too. And I'm
     honoured to be in his company. Or the
     company of those whom G!D sends, for
     they are ridiculed by those of the world,
     since the times of the fathers of those
     who ridicule the messengers of G!D. This is in
     Scriptures. Send me everything you got,
     in your hatred or hate, because G!D is
     the best at planning. And if you wait,
     I, too, will wait. And my fear is
     fear of G!D. Not fear of
     seeming foolish or incompetent, although
     that got to me, too, while chasing
     after yardsticks, what-ever - which I realise,
     that as long as G!D loves me, I need no
     benchmark or yardstick to measure myself
     against, other than my obedience to G!D.
     And how do you measure that? So, any-way.
     
     
  
  <li>
   Back to the 'C', huh. 'Centre of my life'.
   'Character of my life'. Then, another 'C'.
   'Community'. Who are my people?
   A quote goes like this - for G!D has
   given me the chance to see, so freely

   People who play playfully and boldly point
   out baldies who think they have a lustrous

   they do not like it). Yeah, do I wanna

   question, right? The red pill hurts, your
   life will never be the same. Or, you can
   take the blue pill, and pretend all
   <i>these</i> (or <i>this</i>) never happened.
   Go, go on, no one (oh, G!D just humbled me -
   a reminder that human effort counts for
   nothing. And what Scriptures
   record - Paul's concern for
   Corinthians, or people of
   Corinth, comes to mind.) Any-way,
   it's your choice to make. And G!D,
   or Truth, (why? G!D is Truth,
   or, G!D is true and just in His ways
   and judgments; praise be to G!D) 
   G!D, or Truth, is not un-easy to have
   no believers among you. Peace be with you,
   in the name of Christ Jesus. The kingdom
   of G!D is near! It is not far from you!

  'For we brought nothing into the world, andb neither can we carry anything out of it. 8But if we have food and clothing, we will be content with these.

9Those who want to be rich, however, fall into temptation and become ensnared by many foolish and harmful desires that plunge them into ruin and destruction. 10For the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil. By craving it, some have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many sorrows.

Fight the Good Fight
11But you, O man of God, flee from these things and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, perseverance, and gentleness.

  With G!D's help, reading the information

  empowered. If G!D is willing, you may

  do not beat yourself up too much; you do
  not have to do that, even though there
  is a tendency to; or, there can be a tendency to.
  G!D knows, and I do not know, what you are going through.
  G!D knows best what to do with you. I'm just
  glad, if you have been labelled with 'schizophrenia',

  that you have come or visited web-site. The LORD be with

    that what society ultimately benefits
    from requires even rejection from that very same
    society, and definitely a separation from
    society. (and that's putting it mildly.)
    Jesus says it better, or Scriptures: '

  'The poor, deluded fool feeds on ashes. He trusts in something that cannot help him at all! Yet he cannot bring himself to reflect or think to himself: "Is this thing, that I am holding in my hand, a lie?" (Isaiah 44:20) <br/>
  
  And yet, G!D has enabled me to write this, and I thank the Almighty Lord of lords, and King of kings; praise G!D, I do, for He has shown loving-kindness, and mercy that is in the Most High.
  
  To G!D be the glory. <br/>
  
  It took time. And terrors, admonishments (out of dear love), and signs and wonders, G!D has convinced me that He has paid a price to redeem a prostitute like myself. <br/>
  
  'This observance will be for you like a sign on your hand and a reminder on your forehead that this law of the LORD is to be on your lips. For the LORD brought you out of Egypt with his mighty hand.'
  <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/13-9.htm">
  (Exodus 13:9, New International Version)
  </a>
  
  <br/>
  
  'You will tell your son: 'I do this, because the LORD, G!D of Abraham and the Prophets, has done wonders and marvels for me when He brought me out of Egypt.' (Exodus 13:8)
  
  <br/>
  
  So, testify, as a witness of G!D, I shall.
  
  Drugs - things: bitter in taste, white in colour, and smaller than a finger-nail in size. Those whom I turned to - shepherds, of renown in the land -
  charged me money for those things, and kept me in a pen that I could not leave from, even if I asked nicely. <br />
  
  'This thing gives me uneasiness. I wake up in the middle of the night to walk; I feel compelled. And it gives me convulsions in my hands sometimes.' 
  
  This I told them. <br/>
  
  And they said, 'Here's another thing. Eat it. It controls the uneasiness of the thing that you talked about.' <br/>
  
  'But,' they continued, 'It does things to you, even though it controls the thing that you talked about.' <br />
  
  I did not know what they talked about. This thing, that thing. <br />
  
  The shepherds - some of them, at least - intimidated me. 'If you do not do as we say,' they hinted, in a way that was not very nice, 'you will keep staying in this pen. You will not be let out.'
 <br /> 
  So, ate both things, I tremulously did. Indeed, I was afraid of consequences that men promised unto me, instead of fearing the Almighty One.
  
  I wanted to get out of that pen. And so, I dis-obeyed not, but co-operated, although I have voiced my defiance to their ways a few times. <br />
  <br />
  'Finish your food,' they said. And I was afraid. So I ate, although I had been feeling very full at that point.
  <br />
  (Later they would give me a recipe for 'sayur lodeh', when I asked them how to make a certain mixture that I had eaten.)
  
  <br/>
  'Drink water with your "medicine",' they said. And I was fed up. 'No,' I said. 'I am going to eat "medicine" without water. See, it enters my body just fine.' <br />
  
  And they said, in a way that was not very nice, 'Drink water with the "medicine", or else.' <br />
  
  I walked away, but I was anxious to get out of that pen, and keen to appear co-operative. (And they had others to talk to.) So, I returned to them, but they said, 'Don't worry. We've recorded that you were obedient enough. That is, that you have eaten "medicine".'
  <br />
  Anyhow, this story is becoming godless.
  <br />
  Long story short, they left me. they care nothing for me. <br />
  
  All your lovers have forgotten you;
they care nothing for you;
for I have dealt you the blow of an enemy,
the punishment of a merciless foe,
because your guilt is great,
because your sins are flagrant. (Jeremiah 30:14, ESV)
  
  <br/>
  Alas! That day is so great
there is none like it;
it is a time of distress for Jacob;
yet he shall be saved out of it. (Jeremiah 30:7)
  
  <br/>
  
  'For I will restore health to you,
and your wounds I will heal,'

declares the Lord,
'because they have called you an outcast:
"It is Zion, for whom no one cares!" (Jeremiah 30:17)
  
  <br />
  :-)
  <br />
  Therefore all who devour you shall be devoured,
and all your foes, every one of them, shall go into captivity;
those who plunder you shall be plundered,
and all who prey on you I will make a prey.' (Jeremiah 30:16)
  <br />
  'For I am with you to save you,'

declares the Lord;
'I will make a full end of all the nations
among whom I scattered you,
but of you I will not make a full end.
I will discipline you in just measure,
and I will by no means leave you unpunished.' (Jeremiah 30:11)
  <br />
  'Then fear not, O Jacob my servant, declares the Lord,
nor be dismayed, O Israel;
for behold, I will save you from far away,
and your offspring from the land of their captivity.
Jacob shall return and have quiet and ease,
and none shall make him afraid.' (Jeremiah 30:10)
  
 <br />
  Indeed, as it is written in the Bible, G!D exalts those who humble themselves before Him, and humbles those who exalt themselves before Him.
  <br />
  Why?
  <br /> For it is written in the Bible: '
  Now you are slaves
    of other nations,
but I will break the chains
and smash the yokes
    that keep you in slavery.
Then you will be my servants,
and I will choose a king for you
    from the family of David.'
  (Jeremiah 30:8-9, CEV)
  <br />
  Almighty One, great are your deeds! Fabulous, marvellous!
  <br />
  Why?
  <br />
  For is it not written in the Bible: 'Your hearts will swell with joy - even your heart of hearts - and you will be as calves let out to pasture.'
  <br />
  I praise You, G!D, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Your works are wonderful; that I know full well. (from the Bible)
  <br />
  And it is written in the Quran: 'If good touches you, it distresses them; but if harm strikes you, they rejoice at it. And if you are patient and fear Allah , their plot will not harm you at all. Indeed, Allah is encompassing of what they do.'
  <a href="http://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=3&verse=120">(Chapter 3, verse 120)</a>
  
  <br />
   'Bless those who persecute you. Don’t curse them; pray that God will bless them. Be happy with those who are happy, and weep with those who weep.'
  <a href="http://biblehub.com/nlt/romans/12.htm">
   (Romans 12:14-15, NLT)
  </a>
 <br />
  'Dear friends, never take revenge. Leave that to the righteous anger of God. For the Scriptures say,

“I will take revenge;
I will pay them back,”
says the LORD.
Instead,
“If your enemies are hungry, feed them.
If they are thirsty, give them something to drink.
In doing this, you will heap
burning coals of shame on their heads.”
Don’t let evil conquer you, but conquer evil by doing good.'
  (Romans 12:19-21, NLT)
  <br />
  'Be merciful, as your Master is merciful.' - Jesus
  <br />
  So, G!D admonishes and sets trials and obstacles. Admonishes out of dear love. Trials, so that if you overcome, a reward is for you, with the LORD, G!D of Abraham. (Book of Revelations, if you're interested.)
  <br />
  Happily ever after, by a servant of G!D who created Heaven and Earth - G!D who knows all, hears all and sees all (G!D knows and you do not) - G!D who knows the hearts and minds of men, G!D who loves justice, and detests wickedness.
  <br />
  So remind me, G!D, to fear You, and to humble myself before You, and to let Your will be done, not mine.
  <br />
  'And this same God who takes care of me will supply all your needs from his glorious riches, which have been given to us in Christ Jesus.'
  <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians+4%3A19&version=NLT">
  (Phillipians 4:19, NLT)
  </a>
  <br />
  For it is written in the Quran: 'Bring glad tidings, invite them to your LORD, practice charity openly and secretly, and do righteousness that is godly - it is not righteousness to turn to the
  East or the West, but it is righteousness to obey G!D, and to keep His commandments.'

 In the Quran, it is written: 'Take Sadaqah (alms) from their wealth in order to purify them and sanctify them with it, and invoke Allah for them. Verily! Your invocations are a source of security for them, and Allah is All-Hearer, All-Knower.'

 To you who think you have 'mental illness', and are trying to 'control' that with abominations that are man-made, the Bible has a 
 verse, oh the G!D-breathed Word that is suitable for rebuking and disciplining so that you are wise for salvation through
 the Christ: 'A house divided cannot stand'
</p>

<p>
 
 On people who are involved with the death penalty: executioner, legal procedure people. The Bible has said, 'Put away your swords,
 For those who live by the sword will die by the sword.' <br/> And that is supposedly a gift from the Lord Christ Jesus. 'Those who have
 Ears, let them hear,’goes another part of the Bible.
 </p>



<p>
 Now when Jesus was asked 
 'Are you Son of G!d'
 Jesus said 
 'It is as you say. Furthermore, I tell you now that I am resurrecting in three days after my death,
 by the power given me by my Father in Heaven'
 'Blasphemy,' they said, sending Jesus to crucifixion 
 (Thy will be done on Heaven, and thy will be done on earth as on Heaven. O blessed are you, Father in Heaven, King of the Universe, Ruler of Heaven. Hallowed be thy name.)
 Apostle Paul said,
 'My execution of Christians was before the Lord Christ Jesus appeared to me, saying, 'Why are you killing me?'
 Now, conscience of mine, it is clear before G!d and man.'
 It is written in the Bible, 'Christ- the Christ lives in me.'
 And it written in the Bible. What? Paul was preaching to people who heard him, but they began leaving 
 After hearing him say. What?
 You hear always but do not understand
 </p>


<p>
 Routine that is awkward and painful is no longer music to my ears /
 Often, people don't always take care of themselves /
 Why don't they love themselves /
 Birds came in, red /
 and purple too /
 That's what they turned my skin into /
 Ain't that a sharp pain there /
 Oh, why do they hurt me so /
 My kiss to them /
 Lets my blood out /
 They continue chirping /
 Perhaps this is the time /
 to say it's- /
 o /
 it's not okay /
 why do my tears flow /
 oh, joy /
 ow /
 it's time to die, the birds say /
 death-songs come softly /
 please forgive them, Heavenly Compassionate Father /
 Boom
