Dedicated to the G!D of Abraham and the prophets, Almighty Creator, for as long as He will let His servant like myself, (G!D knows where and who His other servants are, and I do not know) glorify Him, who is unseen and is not unmindful of your deeds. Glory be to He who is Sovereign over the Here-after
===============

Blessed is He who hath given His people rest. May all nations come to know that our LORD is G!D; that there is no
other lord other than G!D; that there is no other G!D other than G!D

What makes an altar sacred? Is it the altar? Or is it the temple that makes the altar sacred?

Jesus left the temple and was walking away when his disciples came up to him to call his attention to its buildings. 2 “Do you see all these things?” he asked. “Truly I tell you, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down.”
