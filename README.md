### Introduction

As of 28th June 2020, the web-site at 
[https://phtan.github.io](https://phtan.github.io) is shaping up to be
a wiki about myself - or a memex.

What is a memex?

> “Consider a future device …  in which an individual stores all his 
books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it 
may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an 
enlarged intimate supplement to his memory.” - (Vannevar Bush, 1945)

Source: Vannevar Bush. (1945). "As we may think". In *The Atlantic*.

I first got to know about a memex, through 
[Devine Lu Linvega](https://xxiivv.com/), who is part of the two-person
research studio known as [Hundred Rabbits](https://100r.co/).

### Dedication

Dedicated to the god of Abraham and the prophets, Almighty Creator - for 
as long as He will let His servant, like myself, glorify Him. (G!D knows where and 
who His other servants are, and I do not know).

### Let me quote from the Bible - well, hey, I can pretty well quote from the Bible, if I want

> Jesus left the temple and was walking away when his disciples came up 
to him to call his attention to its buildings. “Do you see all these 
things?” he asked. “Truly I tell you, not one stone here will be left 
on another; every one will be thrown down.” - 
[(Matthew 24:1-2)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2024:1-2)
