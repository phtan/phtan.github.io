Dedicated to the G!D of Abraham and the prophets, Almighty Creator, for as long as He will let His servant like myself, (G!D knows where and who His other servants are, and I do not know) glorify Him, who is unseen and is not unmindful of your deeds. Glory be to He who is Sovereign over the Here-after

What makes an altar sacred? Is it the altar? Or is it the temple that makes the altar sacred?

'Truly, truly, I tell you,' Jesus, son of Mary said, 'the servant is not above the master. 
And the student is not above the teacher. And the
messenger is not above the one who sends the message. But
a fully-trained student will be like the teacher.' (as written in Scripture)

Blessed is He who hath given His people rest. (For as Scriptures have on record, we are being
killed every day, like lambs to the slaughter). May all nations come to know that our lord is G!D; that there is no
other lord other than G!D; that there is no other god other than G!D


Jesus left the temple and was walking away when his disciples came up to him to call his attention to its buildings. 2 “Do you see all these things?” he asked. “Truly I tell you, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down.”
