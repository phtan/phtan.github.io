  <p>Dear Diary,

  Scripture tells me not to say that in
  twenty years you will repay the wicked
  and un-just for what they have
  done, for is not G!d a good G!d? 
  that question
  rings in my 
  mind: Is G!d a G!d, who rewards the wicked?

  'You know of my way of life,
    my persecution at 
    Antioch, my longsuffering,

    Paul, who cautioned in the
    same letter
  </p>
  <p><i>from the writer: 
    As written in Scriptures:
    'What then is Paul? What then
    is Apollo?' (what)
    <br/>
    'G!D loves not those who delight
    in wickedness. Mischief-makers,
    G!D loves not.' (from Scriptures
    that some call the Quran)
    <br/>
    'I want you to show mercy (love),'
    says the LORD G!D, (as written
    in Scriptures.) 'Not to offer
    sacrifices. I want you to know me
    (G!D).'
    <br/>
    Oh, thank You, oh Compassionate
    and Most Merciful One, who is
    swift and severe and terrible
    in punishment: eternal abode
    in Fire, at an hour when there
    will be no (outside) help,
    no intercession, and no hand
    of compassion to be extended;
    and then there will be angels
    striking back and behind 
    and cheeks
    and neck (d√©colletage, heads
    shoulders, knees and toes,
    knees and toes) of people who will
    have displaced lips; and then
    there will be weeping, and
    stamping of feet, most sorrowful,
    and grinding an' gnashing of teeth.
    (ah, that feels extremely
    satisfying, G!D, who reminds me
    to leave the righteous anger
    of G!D to G!D). afore-mentioned
    may be verified to be recorded
    in the Quran, the Bible and elsewhere
    which may or may not be unknown 
    to me.
    <br/>
    And so it is that what the Teacher
    and Lord says is true: 'Blessed
    are you who hunger and thirst
    for righteousness, for you
    will be satisfied.' so says the
    Son of Man. As surely as the LORD
    G!D, the Almighty One lives,
    I hunger and thirst for righteousness,
    for the wicked to have no peace, and 
    no rest, and for those who
    fear G!D to be rewarded and exalted.
    And as surely as the LORD lives,
    I have been satisfied in great
    and mighty ways that I did not know,
    and G!D promises that... this:
    'Call to Me, and I will show
    you great and mighty things
    which you do not know.'

      Dear Diary,
      How are you? 
      May peace
 [and the Life] be with you in
     the name of the Lord Christ Jesus.
    </p>
    <p>from the writer:

      'Do not err, my beloved
      brethren,' wrote the apostle
      Paul, 'every good gift
      and every perfect gift
      is from above, coming down
      from the father of lights,
      [the blessed Father, who
      is unseen in front of men,
      and who is in Heaven]
      with whom there is no
      variableness or changing
      or turning of shadow
      [nor excessively heavy
      yokes like those that
      teachers of the Law, and
      Pharisees, and hypocrites,
      lay down even on the very
      aged]'.
    </p>
    <p>The Almighty has drawn evening across the
      earth, and the man ponders on himself and
      his G!d. He is a strange creation, he thinks,
      growing as he appears, and also aware of his on[-]going
      dis[-]appearance. For which part of his body is new,
      or his bones, or his flesh, that will prompt a new
      'Thing' in the world? [paragraph break] And yes,
      the uncertainty of his existence threatens him,
      and waits in hiding to be acknowledged, on the heels
      of Recognition.
    </p>
    <p>G[!]d brought people to me to[-]day, Diary, and some
      of the experience was pleasant, and some not so much.
      Three of my former high-school class[-]mates arrived at the
      ward, and G!d reminded me later of my vulnerability
      amidst serving the Christ, when [H]e brought my [']father[']
      to the ward (he is not a seeker of the Christ, nor is he seeking
      Christ, as far as I can tell.)

    <p>Do you speak Mandarin Chinese, or can you read it, at least?

    <p><i>from the writer: Translating... :-) For the love of G!D,
      and to the Most Merciful and Compassionate One be praise and
      the glory.
      </i>
    </p>
    <p>Although I do not count myself as having achieved perfection,
      as if I were a mountain or statue that has been molded and
      made perfect - oh, I do not count myself as such - and do not
      have all the powers that G!D has to work great deeds that shelter
      and transport Man, and nourish you and me, and do not know
      all the rigid instructions, of the world, that lays a yoke
      on-to one such that one turns to the direction where the sun
      sets, or plucks hair out from the nostrils of one - oh, 
      I feel a load that is yoked upon me, instead, in 
      the plentiful harvest of the fields that G!D has given me to
      tend, as if I ought to forge a bow or axe for myself out-side of
      the houses of happy people who put the proverbial cart before the horse,
      among these blurring definitions (of myself)
      that G!D has caused in a baptism of fire to a disobedient
      one such as myself, who seems doomed to be as clouds
      of dust and ash - what with the sword, that He has plunged into
      my soul, that is tormenting me greatly - I speak, in an effort
      to make my humanity heard, the following: if G!D has given me 
      this worldly life as a comfort - a form of mercy
      from the Most Merciful and Compassionate One, or a brief respite -
      then what they have done to me falls short of what lets
      the light of the Most Merciful One - who created us, and is working
      great and mighty wonders in His immeasurable splendour and
      ways that are above my own - shine;
      they do not glorify their Maker, who is maker of all. I see
      room for the Lamb to do the will of the one who sent the Lamb. I see
      room for work that reconciles the below to the above. I see 
      a gap to be filled. And how great the cry must be
      to He-who-provides, from where they are! Oh, to imagine
      the saltiness that remains on their hearts after their tears
      have dried! To borrow an expression
      from the one and only Teacher, 
      if this happens in the green, what more in the dry!
    </p>
    <p><i>Mysterious marks that look like armies or soldiers
      </i>
    </p>
    <p>Where G!D has sent me to is where wild people
      have the comfort of their shelters and women, and yet
      bake bread that leaves people half-hungry after they eat it.
      Not a joyous effort at all, are all these plucking of nostril-hairs,
      and turning to the direction where the sun sets. To the extent
      that they have turned the commandments of G!D to suit the desires
      of their hearts, they are all alike, regardless of their
      positions in society, gender identity, sexual identity, and
      the number of years that they have lived (or the number
      of wrinkles
      on their fore-head). And these are people who are made
      in the likeness of their Maker! How outrageous! I am
      greatly anxious and distressed for these people whom
      G!D offers His covenant to. My lowly heart is beset with
      with unexpressed emotions, as if my heart were in a sealed
      jar that is becoming a little too cramped, or as if the heat
      of summer had been poured into a drink that leaves me burning
      upon consumption. Oh, to whom shall I turn the ancient
      trees and mountains of my soul towards: G!D who clothes me,
      or those whom G!D has destroyed since long ago in plagues
      and floods and earthquakes that only those who are like Noah
      can be spared from? Who am I to model myself after? Or who
      am I to speak up for? Or rest my weary soul against? O! How
      I have spent nights sitting, by my lonesome, under the shifts
      and changes of the moon, wishing to be with You, enjoying
      the lush abundance of what G!D provides in his covenant with
      an oppressed, persecuted and doomed one such as myself!
      O, Jehovah!
    </p>
    <p>oh, in the heat of the day, I have felt humiliation.

    G!d sent four former high school friends to me in the evening.
      When I looked on the gifts which one brought to me, I saw the
      words: 'When you only see one set of footprints in
      the sand, it is because I was carrying you.' That was awesome!
  </p>
  <p>
    Scripture says that you ought to
    say, 'If this is G!d's will, we will
    live and also do this or that,' instead
    of boasting that tomorrow you will
    go to this or that city, live there for
    a few years and make a profit. This is a 
    reminder from G!d to me about my limits
    and capabilities.
    </p>
  <p>You are <strike>like</strike> an open
    book, Diary, and I trust G!d will involve 
    you in his [or His]
    plan as he [or He] sees fit.
  </p>
  <p>
    I received many blessings from the Father
    today. I am especially grateful as I had prayed
    to die, earlier.
  </p>
  <p>G!d is telling me that there is more
    to me that he sees, other than what I see[,] and what they see.
    The word of G!d is a lamp unto thy path[,] and a 
    light unto thy feet.
    <strike>(Psalms</strike>
    The context is the words I saw earlier in a [']Christian[']
    publication, on the trees and tents that G!d sees in a group
    of wanderers and ex-slaves.
