Dear Diary,
    How are you? May peace be with you
    in the name of the Lord Christ Jesus.

  <p>If I had a wing / I would not flap but / boldly cover me
  </p>
  <p>
  <i>from the writer: If G[!]d had a wing / would He use it
    to carry / The sound of the trees

    Am I so vulnerable
    <br/><br/>
    <i>from the writer: 'With gladness I boast about thorn
      in flesh (that was given to me to torment me, and to keep
      me from being proud - a messenger of the one who calls himself
      the Angel of Light), delight in weaknesses, and gladly boast
      about troubles, persecutions, oppression from people unknown
      and known to me, hardships, emotional turns and swoops and 
      flights, tribulations, for the sake of the One with the Name
      (Christ).' (from Scriptures)

    Am I so vulnerable that a[n] offer of a mixture is
    deceiving
    and
    tempting? Are you?
    They have familiarity with toxins. It's so embittering,
    disappointing and upsetting! Oh!
  </p>
  <p>from the writer: 'Remorseful, huh. Regrets? Or not? For the sake
    of the Christ, huh. The Anointed One who calls himself the 
    son of Man. "Three times I asked the Lord to remove it
    from me. What? The thing causing (me) pain. The thorn in flesh.
    He said: My grace is sufficient for you. Good enough. Enough for
    you, my grace is. My power is greatest in weakness.

  <p>On the day of the Sabbath, Shaddai settles into his [or His]

  <p>The awesome G!d is with you, Diary, and He will

    Oh, such mercy, as Pope Francis said: so much mercy, especially
    for confessors!
    <p>G!d sent four former high school
  </p>
  <p><i>from the writer: (laughing) hur-hur-hur-hur. Four... form.. er...
    form-er... four.. form... four... for... It's too funny! :-D ^.^ (still
    laughing) ha- G!D is better comedian than I am :-D Thanks, Daddy :-) ^.^

    G!d sent four former high school friends to me in the evening.
      When I looked on the gifts which one brought to me, I saw the
      words: 'When you only see one set of footprints in
      the sand, it is because I was carrying you.' That was awesome!
  </p>
  <p>
    Scripture says that you ought to
    say, 'If this is G!d's will, we will
    live and also do this or that,' instead
    of boasting that tomorrow you will
    go to this or that city, live there for
    a few years and make a profit. This is a 
    reminder from G!d to me about my limits
    and capabilities.
    </p>
  <p>You are <strike>like</strike> an open
    book, Diary, and I trust G!d will involve 
    you in his [or His]
    plan as he [or He] sees fit.
  </p>
  <p>
    I received many blessings from the Father
    today. I am especially grateful as I had prayed
    to die, earlier.
  </p>
  <p>G!d is telling me that there is more
    to me that he sees, other than what I see[,] and what they see.
    The word of G!d is a lamp unto thy path[,] and a 
    light unto thy feet.
    <strike>(Psalms</strike>
    The context is the words I saw earlier in a [']Christian[']
    publication, on the trees and tents that G!d sees in a group
    of wanderers and ex-slaves.

    They call for bed-time / <br/>
    On a summer night in trop-ics / <br/>
    What a silent moon!

    From the writer: they call for bed-time / on a Sabbath that Lord rules /
    how patient Lord is!
