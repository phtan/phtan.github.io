  <p>Dear Diary,
    Strangled and a-ware / 
    I comb fingers in-to ash /
    as I dis-ap-pear
    <br/><br/>
    They fold the-ir hands /
    As they sit a-cross from me /
    How do I praise G!d
    <br/><br/>
    They came on a day /
    When it was cold and wind-less /
    They came suddenly
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Tiles and small stock-piles /
    Bring on a cas-cade of fear /
    and the stop in me
    <br/>
    <br/>
    They pushed some bis-cuit /
    and mix-ture to me at tea /
    They shan't break my fast!
    <br/>
    <br/>
    On a ce-real crack /
    The rai-sin traced me as best /
    as a dry <strike>hump</strike>lump
    can
    <br/><br/>
    The wild crane stands fast /
    A-mong te rol-ling grass field /
    As he jour-neys past
    <br/><br/>
    They are in a war /
    They are wield-ing seen weapons /
    But we, un-seen, win
    <br/><br/>
    They are in a war /
    They are seen wielding weapons /
    But we win, unseen
    <br/><br/>
    To make a dam burst /
    It is im-por-tant to risk /
    Flood-ing the ri-ver
    <br/><br/>
    How many swallows /
    Follow the si-lence as well /
    As a stag-nant pond?
    <br/><br/>
    How many swallows follow the 
    selection of an old 
    stagnant 
    pond?
    <br/><br/>
    Day comes and night goes /
    Silk-i-ly e-nough on wings /
    of a red fea-ther
    <br/><br/>
    The bumblebee flies /
    Listening to the sounds of snorts /
    and grumbling hammers
    <br/><br/>
    <i>from the writer: Lest they
      tramply on them, and then turn
      and attack you, do not set 
      your pearls before swine.'
      (hur-hur-huk) (laughing)
      This is from Scriptures.

    The bumblebee flies /
    But tastes its own honey in /
    no such haste as Man

    On the equator

    / up leaving I

Dear Diary,
    How are you? May peace be with you
    in the name of the Lord Christ Jesus.

  <p>If I had a wing / I would not flap but / boldly cover me

    Am I so vulnerable
    <br/><br/>
    <i>from the writer: 'With gladness I boast about thorn
      in flesh (that was given to me to torment me, and to keep
      me from being proud - a messenger of the one who calls himself
      the Angel of Light), delight in weaknesses, and gladly boast
      about troubles, persecutions, oppression from people unknown
      and known to me, hardships, emotional turns and swoops and 
      flights, tribulations, for the sake of the One with the Name
      (Christ).' (from Scriptures)

    <br/><br/>
    Am I so vulnerable that a[n] offer of a mixture is
    deceiving
    and
    tempting? Are you?
    They have familiarity with toxins. It's so embittering,
    disappointing and upsetting! Oh!

  <p>from the writer: 'Remorseful, huh. Regrets? Or not? For the sake
    of the Christ, huh. The Anointed One who calls himself the 
    son of Man. "Three times I asked the Lord to remove it
    from me. What? The thing causing (me) pain. The thorn in flesh.
    He said: My grace is sufficient for you. Good enough. Enough for
    you, my grace is. My power is greatest in weakness.

    Oh, such mercy, as Pope Francis said: so much mercy, especially

    <p>G!d sent four former high school

    <p>
    G!d sent four former high school friends to me in the evening.
      When I looked on the gifts which one brought to me, I saw the
      words: 'When you only see one set of footprints in
      the sand, it is because I was carrying you.' That was awesome!
  </p>
  <p>
    Scripture says that you ought to
    say, 'If this is G!d's will, we will
    live and also do this or that,' instead
    of boasting that tomorrow you will
    go to this or that city, live there for
    a few years and make a profit. This is a 
    reminder from G!d to me about my limits
    and capabilities.
    </p>
  <p>You are <strike>like</strike> an open
    book, Diary, and I trust G!d will involve 
    you in his [or His]
    plan as he [or He] sees fit.
  </p>
  <p>
    I received many blessings from the Father
    today. I am especially grateful as I had prayed
    to die, earlier.
  </p>
  <p>G!d is telling me that there is more
    to me that he sees, other than what I see[,] and what they see.
    The word of G!d is a lamp unto thy path[,] and a 
    light unto thy feet.
    <strike>(Psalms</strike>
    The context is the words I saw earlier in a [']Christian[']
    publication, on the trees and tents that G!d sees in a group
    of wanderers and ex-slaves.
