    Sang song of Moses, who is servant
    of G!D, and of the Lamb. (from
    book of Revelations,
    which?   in Scriptures)<br/>
    'Great and awe-inspiring 
    are Your splendid deeds, Almighty One!
    Fabuloso.. fabulosa
    (fabulous)
    worthy of praises and odes...
    marvellous and miraculously powerful.
    <br /                >
    true and just are 
    your ways and deeds,
    Ruler and        king 
    of the ages and the nations.'

    G!D gave
    me a chance
    to
    have
    a set of leading
    questions. to
    you, who are alien to
    me, or foreign or
    unknown to me:
    in love of G!D, first and foremost,
    then, to love G!D - 
    who hath called us to peace,
    a peace the world does not give -
    and to do something like 
    loving G!D, that is, to love
    the unknown as the you -
    that is, to love 
    neighbour as yourself -
    to love the other,
    who is unknown to me, as myself,
    giving you what G!D has given me,
    as freely as G!D has given me through
    
    the glorious riches of Christ
    Jesus.

      <b>three steps every meeting</b>
      [in no particular order of importance]
      <ol>,
        
        <li>Share. You don't have
          to if you don't wanna. (Buddy: listen
          and ask questions to clarify,
          if needed. And of course, 
          how to listen is a skill 
          altogether delightful to practise.)
        </li>
        <li>Suggest. You can, if you want,
          ask your buddy 
          for specific 
          advice or help. (Buddy: offer ideas,
          options, and suggestions.)
        </li>
        <li>Set action. What will I
          work on this coming week-day
          or week-end or what.
          G!D knows what time measure you use,
          and I do not know. Yes, G!D knows, and I do not know.
          (Buddy: check that
          goal is something you can
          verify)
        </li>
    </ol>
      
    </p>
  <p>With G!D's help, I have an example
    of how to do the above. It is that which follows:
  </p>
    <p>
      share
      <ul>
        <li>what progress or effort did I
          make this week?
          <i>as it is written in Scriptures:
            I saw my co-worker eating and drinking
            with drunkards, and I have admonished
            him... them... her. 
            I have sternly and clearly warned my
            co-workers to turn away from
            godless chatter, and those who
            have opposing ideas with so-called 'knowledge'
            or false knowledge - yes, even those
            who have spent a large portion of their
            [G!D-provided]
            lives steeping themselves in false knowledge.
            I have warned my co-workers to turn away
            from those kinds of people. Also, I have 
            pointed out the hypocrispy of people
            un-abashedly, without shame, even [the
            hypocrispy of] those
            who call themselves 'your mother' or '
            your friend'
            or 'your father'. Does not the tempter who
            has the name of Satan in Scriptures (Satan,
            Shaitan, also known as Belial) call
            himself... herself... themself... the
            Angel of Light? So, what does one,
            who associates himself or herself with
            the Anointed One who calls himself the Son of
            Man, (the Christ, in other words)
            have to do with the tempter
            who calls himself... herself... themself...
            the Angel of Light? 
            Separate yourself from them.
            Come out from among them.
            Believers and unbelievers 
            were originally unsuitable for each other.
            what harmony does the Christ have with
            the one who calls himself the Angel of Light:
            the tempter?
          </i>
        </li>
        <li>What did I achieve?
          <i>I don't care for anything
            that the LORD G!D does not give
            me. We will be content with
            food and drink. (as written in 
            Scriptures). Content with
            godliness. What did achieve?
            G!D forbid that I should glory
            in myself, save in the one
            eternal sacrifice of the One
            who has the Name, Jesus, the 
            Christ, through whom 
            I am crucified unto the world,
            and the world unto me. :-D
          </i>
          Did I achieve or hit the goal I set last
          week or some time ago?
          <i>This question I decline answer.
            However, what does not work
            for me, might help you in G!D-knows-what
            you-are-doing-and-I-do-not-know.
            Err. Well, I took up a habit of smoking
            cigarettes.
            With the help of G!D, I have a testimony
            that, as surely as the LORD lives, I did not resume
            smoking after I decided to stop or quit
            the habit. Wow, that makes me feel
            really good. Thanks, G!D, for
            believing in me, and enabling
            me to very joyfully witness your works
            in my life, and enabling me to be among
            the Believers. to G!D be the glory for-ever
            and ever. Amen.
