<h3>
The wondrous works my god has done in my life
</h3>
<body>
<ol>
<li>In late 2013 A.D. or early 2014, I was alone at night on a long stretch of road. Before I knew it, I had a pack of dogs, which had lined
themselves down the road, barking at me. I did not see how I could leave. Just when I thought I was in a terrible situation,
a stranger came by in a car. I waved to him and miraculously, that stranger stopped for me and let me in. I thank my god for that rescue.
That stranger would drop me off in a place that was better-lit (by street-lamps), and did not charge me any money for the ride.
</li>
  <li>This happened between the years 2016 A.D. to 2018 A.D. In Indonesia, I was feeling thirsty. I was on a mini-bus then, and if I had brought water with me, I had run out of it. Looking around, ,
    I saw a water-bottle in a dustbin (or trash-can) that was inside the bus. Long story short, I drank it. And I thank my god that he gives
    me what is needful for me. As it is written, the Lord is my shepherd; I shall not be in want. (Psalm 23)
  </li>
  <li>A man who was physically bulkier than me sat on top of me as I laid down on the bed, stomach down. He unbuckled my belt and I had the
    impression that he wanted sexual activities with me. I shook my head. "You don't want [it]," he said, and left the hotel room that
    we were both in. I don't think I had that much influence over his decision to leave. Maybe my god rescued me. My god is my saviour and my Rock.
    </li>

  <h3>A longer story about God and me
    </h3>
  <p>
  At some point in time between the years 2013 and 2017, I was acutely aware that something was just not quite right with my life.
    I've felt that way, before 2013, I guess, but it had become something I just could not ignore. I somehow ended up doing the 
    following:
    <ul>
      <li>travelling to Thailand, perhaps hoping that I could escape my problems if I travelled
      </li>
      <li>drinking alcoholic beverages
        
      </li>
      <li>sending myself to an institution of psychiatry, which might have been called a sanitarium or asylum, in older days.
      </li>
      <li>asking for help from certain members of the staff of the university that I was then enrolled in, as an undergraduate.
        One particular member of the staff
        would accuse me of being possessed by "the devil".
      </li>
      <li>stealing food from a refridgerator/fridge that was shared among my dormitory-mates, among other fridges
      </li>
      </ul>
    Long story short, I felt better after reading verses from the Bible. Epistles (or letters) by the apostle Paul helped me, in particular.
    I grew to fear God, in a gradual process. 
  </p>
  <p>As I read more about God from the Bible, I discovered, or realised, that 
    I have done things that God finds abominable. For example, God says in the Old Testament that 
    "thou shalt not steal (you shall not steal)". (Exodus 20:15). 
    <p>I asked God to help me be a better person, if only to end my suffering,
    if only to feel better. It seemed that I could not help myself feel better, no matter how much I tried. I guess it could be said
    that I tried to repent. I am still trying to repent. 
  </p>
      <p>I think God loves me. He is giving me kindness. For example, I have sunshine
    most of the time (I need sunshine). And God made the sun. Plus, I grew to believe someone, or some being, or an existence other than
    my own, died in my place. Like, I believe I deserved to be struck dead after doing things that God doesn't like - in other words,
    I should have died for my sins (including stealing). But someone called Jesus, whom I would later address as Lord Jesus, suffered
    the punishment for my sins. I believe God is forgiving. I frequently ask God to forgive me. Lord Jesus has said, "Forgive, and you
    will be forgiven". So I try to forgive others whom I encounter in everyday life. It could be the staff of a restaurant who abruptly
    cleans the table I'm at, without so much as a smile at me. Lord Jesus taught mankind a prayer that includes the line, "Father in Heaven [...],
    forgive us our debts, as we have forgiven our debtors". So, I ask God to be nice to that particular member of the restaurant-staff
    who did not smile at me, who seemed so robot-like to me. I do this in the hopes that I myself am forgiven.
        
    
  </p>
  <p>Long story short, and as a way to summarise the above, I note the following:
    <ol>
      <li>I felt distressed, severely so
      </li>
      <li>I exhausted all the ways I could find to make myself feel better, without success
      </li>
      <li>I came across verses in the Bible. Or, as I now believe, God sent the Bible to me, in His generosity.
      </li>
      <li>I asked God for wisdom to understand what I have read in the Bible. (And if I have wisdom now, I believe it was
        God who gave it to me. And I believe God is still giving wisdom to me, as I write this - consider me a fool!)
      </li>
      <li>I acted based on what I read in the Bible.
      </li>
      <li>I am happy now. I am in God's care.
      </li>
  </ol>
