<head>Jesus said, 'I have not much more time to
speak with you. The ruler of 
this world is approaching.
He has no power over Me,
yet I will do the will of the one
who sent Me, so that the world
will know that I love my Father.
If you really loved me, you will
be glad that I am going to my Father,
for He is greater than I.'
<br/>
'I am leaving you now, but I will come
again, and we will be together forever
and always, walking along
the straight path to the lasting wealth
from my Father - a wealth the world does not give,
a wealth I bring, and 

which
will not be taken
away from you. And surely I will
always be with you, forever and always
until the very end of the world,
and the true end of the age,
and the passing away of this generation.'

'There are many rooms in my Father's house.
I am going there to prepare one for you.'

As Scriptures say, 'For we of the spirit of G!D
have different abilities
according to the action of the Spirit
of G!D in our lives.
Just as a body has different 
members with different functions,
so, too, we are of one body
- through the Anointed One, Jesus, 
who calls himself the Son of Man -
and have different gifts in the same
body. If your gift is teaching, teach.
If your gift is devotion to
G!D, which may or may not be done
in secret before men, then devote 
yourself to G!D. (For what you do
in secret before men, the All-knowing,
All-seeing and All-hearing One
will know, and your reward is with Him,
who is not unmindful of your deeds.'
</p>

Poems that I wro
te with G!D's help during
a stay at a ward
in an institute of mental health,
where and when there was
involuntary medication (bitter-tasting
white things were pressured into you)
and restrictions on your coming and going
from that place - effectively an arrest 
in a prison of sorts, as dainty
as the fittings of the interiors may be.
Blaming no-one; it was a journey
towards G!D - He sends trials. As Scriptures
say, this calls for patient endurance and wisdom
and vigilance and sobriety. (not society,
for as Jesus said,
to what shall I compare this generation?
they are like children calling out to others
in a market-place: 'We sang a dirge, but you
did not cry. We played a song, but
you did not dance.'
And as Scriptures exhort, 'Save yourselves
from this perverse generation!
Repent [of your wrong-doings against
G!D, who is the Most Accepting
of repentance], and be baptised
into the Father (who is given
great happiness to give the kingdom to
you, so do not
be afraid; take courage), the Son (who obeys the Father to 
the point of death, so that the world
will know love for the Father - not love
for the world), and the Holy Spirit (on which
G!D knows best - yes, G!D knows and I,
a servant of G!D, do not know).
</p>
Also, to unknown persons - forces,
beings, angels, demons, rulers in
the sky above or the earth below,
fellows in the Spirit of G!D
(for if G!D is our help, who can
condemn us, as Scriptures have
on record), the unknown- oh,
and the one who calls
himself... herself...
themselves... a fairy, too
- in my life who
have prayed for me, or helped me in
one way or another, psychically or in
visible ways or in unknown
ways (G!D knows and I do not know),
praise be to G!D.
