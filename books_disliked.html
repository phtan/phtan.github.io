<h3>Books I dislike
</h3>
<p>I may dislike the following books, but I pray to (a Biblical) God
that God nourishes their authors in good and perfect ways. I pray in 
the name of Lord Christ Jesus. Amen.

<p><b>Cyril Wong and Md Mukul Hossine. "Me migrant".
</b>
</p>
<p>This is a book of Cyril Wong's "transcreations" (whatever a "transcreated poem" means) of Md Mukul Hossine's poems, titled "Me migrant".
</p>
<p>
I didn't enjoy the few pages I've read.
</p>
<p>
Don't get me wrong, I am passionate about serving migrant-workers in Singapore. But I fail to appreciate the "poetry" on display in this book.
</p>
<p>
How many times can one read "poetic allusions" to the sky, in one sitting, anyway: Page 10 ("my mind's sky"), Page 14 ("pain's blue sky"), who-knows-how-many-more skies..
</p>
<p>
And Cyril Wong's Editorial Note led me to think that I am reading Mr. Cyril Wong's caricature of Mr. Md Mukul Hossine. ("Warm, trusting, garrulous").
</p>
<p>
Perhaps the team behind this book might find it helpful to read Edward Said's "Orientalism" and see how its elements may apply to the dynamics between the middle class of Singapore and the migrant-workers on the island.
</p>
<p>
I am off to read a play by Elfriede Jelinek, "what happened after Nora left her husband", which is related to Ibsen's "A doll's house". I enjoy that much more
