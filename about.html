<h3>About me
</h3>
<p>
In March 2018, I left my undergraduate-studies in Computer Science, even
 though it was my Final Year of the course of study. I just didn't 
 believe anymore in what I was doing. I wasn't enjoying my time, and it 
 was taking a toll on my mental health. So, I left.
</p>
<p>
Here's part of my beliefs:
<ul>
<li>I can enjoy myself, and serve society/mankind at the same time
</li>
<li>I can be contented with my material lifestyle (eg. What to eat, what to drink, what to wear).
</li>
</ul>

Fast-forward two years (since I left University), I am enjoying myself, and I am managing to have (enough) material comfort.
<p>

<p><b>What am I doing now?</b>
</p>
<p>
Right now, I am participating in an exchange of language and culture, with international people, as part of the organisation Mundo Lingo.
</p>
<p>
Mundo Lingo has a presence in many cities, and in light of the pandemic, we have moved from in-person gatherings to online chat-groups.
</p>
<p>
I do not ask for a salary for my work with Mundo Lingo - in my limited knowledge, nobody in Mundo Lingo gets a salary - but I do feel rewarded with friendships and what internationals share with me, about their home culture and language. (You may already know that I am teaching Singlish, or Singapore-flavoured English language, to at least one Burmese lady, as part of such work).
</p>
<p>
I believe in continuing education - in the hopes of learning the Indonesian language, I had a one-hour chat with an England-based Indonesian, over the Internet.
</p>
<p>
And I'm taking a eight-week online course as well, "Writing in the sciences". From Stanford University, and happily, free of charge. It's Week 3 for me now. Yesterday I learnt more about punctuating my sentences for variety
</p>
<p>
About painting - while clearing my emails, I got more ideas for my artistic practice: various gallerists introduced new media or new artists
