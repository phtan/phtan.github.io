  So that my Father who is unseen before those of the world - my only Father - may be glorified. The
  Merciful - Most Merciful - and Compassionate One, the Accepting of repentance.
    <br/>
    And so that the commandments may be obeyed by a lowly heart and poor spirit such as myself:
    <ul>
      <li>Love G!D with all your heart, soul, spirit, body, mind and psychic power and unknown powers
        and any other powers you may have, and all your eyes - seen and unseen. This is the foundation of
        the Law and the prophets - the first and most important and greatest commandment.
      </li>
      <li>
        Love thy neighbour as yourself. This, the second commandment, is like it (the first commandment). :-)
      </li>
      <li>
        To the disciples of the Anointed One, who calls himself the Son of Man: 'this is a new commandment I give to you.
        Love one another as I have loved you. By this, the world will know that you are my disciples, when you love
        one another as I have loved you. (the 'I am', who have spake unto you, who argued among yourselves about who the greatest 
        among you is, and have saith that the greatest among you will serve you).'
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br/>
    And especially to my enemies who hath tormented me, (Man's ways all seem innocent to Him, but the LORD weighs each motive)
    so that they may have the comfort of knowing they are not alone in their emotional upheavals, if G!D accepts their repentance
    and reconciliation to G!D - for G!D knows and I do not know who or where or how or what G!D chooses to <strike>pour</strike>
    breathe
    His Spirit into. <br/>
    And as an advance: worship me not - do not worship me. I am a servant of G!D, just like you. Worship G!D
